# Using WebAssembly

XSIGMA-Wasm is a prototype infrastructure that enables the compilation of XSIGMA C++ code to WebAssembly via Emscripten. This feature is still under active development.

To learn more about XSIGMA-Wasm and its capabilities, please take a look at the following resources:

* [Examples of WebAssembly applications that use XSIGMA for rendering.](https://gitlab.kitware.com/xsigma/xsigma/-/tree/master/Examples/Emscripten/Cxx)

* [A collection of XSIGMA web-based benchmark applications.](https://github.com/Kitware/xsigmaWasmBenchmarks)

* [A guide on using the experimental WebGPU feature in XSIGMA-Wasm.](https://discourse.xsigma.org/t/guide-how-do-i-use-xsigma-wasm-webgpu-experimental-feature/11164).

* [Instructions for building XSIGMA using Emscripten for WebAssembly.](../advanced/build_wasm_emscripten.md)

* [xsigma-wasm-docker](https://gitlab.kitware.com/xsigma/xsigma-wasm-docker) for building and publishing the [`kitware/xsigma-wasm`](https://hub.docker.com/r/kitware/xsigma-wasm) docker images.

* [Deep dive into WebAssembly & WebGPU in XSIGMA: presentation from April 28th, 2023](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nl0TVa55616QKCSHP54BoYBvByMKe6lIUl6IFZqSeJo/edit#slide=id.p). This presentation covers topics such as Emscripten, XSIGMA-wasm Docker image, WASM Dev tools, XSIGMA and WebGPU: PolyData Mapper, API inspection with RenderDoc, and performance profiles.

We welcome your feedback and contributions to this project. Feel free to share your experiences, questions, and ideas in the [web/xsigma-wasm](https://discourse.xsigma.org/c/web/xsigma-wasm/12) category of the XSIGMA Discourse forum. Stay tuned for updates and new developments!
