# General Limitations

## Overview

While the New Curve Framework (NCF) provides a robust and flexible approach to curve construction, it is important to understand its limitations and constraints. This section outlines the key limitations, their implications, and recommended mitigation strategies.

## Mathematical and Numerical Limitations

### Optimization Convergence

The framework's optimization-based approach introduces several potential limitations:

| Limitation Type | Description | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Local Minima** | Algorithm may converge to suboptimal solutions | Medium | Multiple starting points, robust initialization |
| **Ill-Conditioning** | Poor Jacobian matrix conditioning causes instability | High | Regularization, condition monitoring |
| **Convergence Failure** | Optimization fails under extreme conditions | Low | Fallback algorithms, manual intervention |
| **Numerical Precision** | Finite precision arithmetic accumulates errors | Low | Extended precision, error monitoring |

**Detailed Analysis:**

**Local Minima Risk:**
- **Cause**: Non-convex objective function with multiple local optima
- **Indicators**: Inconsistent results with different initial conditions
- **Mitigation**: Multi-start optimization, global search algorithms
- **Monitoring**: Track objective function values across different runs

**Ill-Conditioned Problems:**
- **Cause**: Highly correlated instruments or data-sparse regions
- **Indicators**: Large condition numbers (>10¹²), unstable solutions
- **Mitigation**: Tikhonov regularization, instrument selection review
- **Monitoring**: Daily condition number tracking and alerting

### Interpolation Limitations

**Extrapolation Accuracy**:
- Limited accuracy when extrapolating beyond the range of market data
- Particularly problematic for very long-term or very short-term queries
- Mitigation: Conservative extrapolation methods and explicit uncertainty quantification

**Interpolation Method Constraints**:
- Each interpolation method has inherent limitations and assumptions
- No single method is optimal for all curve regions or market conditions
- Mitigation: Hybrid interpolation approaches and method selection criteria

**Smoothness vs. Accuracy Trade-off**:
- Increased smoothing may reduce fitting accuracy to market data
- Reduced smoothing may lead to unrealistic curve shapes
- Mitigation: Adaptive smoothing based on data quality and market conditions

### Algorithmic Differentiation Limitations

**Computational Complexity**:
- AD computational cost scales with the number of parameters
- Memory requirements can be substantial for large problems
- Mitigation: Sparse matrix techniques and computational optimization

**Numerical Precision**:
- Finite precision arithmetic can accumulate errors in complex calculations
- Particularly relevant for higher-order derivatives
- Mitigation: Extended precision arithmetic where necessary and error monitoring

## Market Data Limitations

### Data Quality Dependencies

**Market Data Accuracy**:
- Framework accuracy is fundamentally limited by input data quality
- Errors in market data propagate directly to curve construction
- Mitigation: Comprehensive data validation and multiple source verification

**Data Completeness**:
- Missing or sparse market data reduces curve construction accuracy
- Particularly challenging in emerging markets or during market stress
- Mitigation: Intelligent gap-filling procedures and uncertainty quantification

**Data Consistency**:
- Inconsistent data across different sources can lead to arbitrage violations
- Time synchronization issues can create apparent arbitrage opportunities
- Mitigation: Data reconciliation procedures and timestamp validation

### Market Condition Dependencies

**Extreme Market Conditions**:
- Framework performance may degrade during extreme market stress
- Assumptions about market behavior may break down during crises
- Mitigation: Stress testing and crisis-specific procedures

**Low Liquidity Environments**:

- Wide bid-ask spreads increase uncertainty in curve positioning
- Mitigation: Liquidity-adjusted weighting and uncertainty modeling

**Market Structure Changes**:
- Changes in market structure may require framework modifications
- New instrument types may not be immediately supported
- Mitigation: Regular framework updates and flexible architecture

## Model Assumptions and Limitations

### Arbitrage-Free Assumption

**Perfect Market Assumption**:
- Framework assumes perfect arbitrage-free markets
- Real markets may have temporary arbitrage opportunities
- Mitigation: Tolerance bands and arbitrage violation monitoring

**Transaction Cost Neglect**:
- Framework does not account for transaction costs or bid-ask spreads
- May lead to overly tight arbitrage relationships
- Mitigation: Bid-ask spread incorporation in validation procedures

### Single Market Data Set Assumption

**Temporal Consistency**:
- Assumes all market data is from the same time point
- Real-world data may have timing inconsistencies
- Mitigation: Data timestamp validation and synchronization procedures

**Source Consistency**:
- Assumes consistent pricing methodology across all data sources
- Different sources may use different conventions or assumptions
- Mitigation: Source-specific adjustments and reconciliation procedures

## Computational and Performance Limitations

### Scalability Constraints

## Conclusion

While the NCF has significant limitations, these are well-understood and actively managed through comprehensive quality control procedures, risk management practices, and continuous improvement efforts. Users should be aware of these limitations and ensure they are appropriately considered in all applications of the framework.

The key to successful usage is understanding the limitations, implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, and maintaining ongoing vigilance for potential issues. Regular validation, monitoring, and enhancement ensure that the framework continues to meet its intended objectives while operating within its known constraints.
