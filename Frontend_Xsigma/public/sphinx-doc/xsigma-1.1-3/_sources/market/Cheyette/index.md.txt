# Cheyette Local Vol Model
The Cheyette Local Volatility (CLV) model is a sophisticated short rate model designed to capture skew effects in volatility surfaces while maintaining fast calibration and pricing capabilities. This model represents an advancement over traditional short rate models by incorporating local volatility with displaced skew, making it particularly suitable for pricing complex structured interest rate derivatives.

The CLV model bridges the gap between simpler models like Heath-Jarrow-Morton 1-factor (HJM1) and more complex models like Quadratic Gaussian 2-factor (QG2), offering:

- Fast calibration and pricing capabilities
- Comprehensive skew effect capture
- Simplified implementation compared to multi-factor models
- Flexibility for future extensions

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, implementing, and using the Cheyette Local Vol Model for pricing Bermudan swaptions, callable inverse floaters (CIF), and callable capped floaters (CCF). Enhanced with actual C++ implementation details from Our project, it serves as both theoretical reference and practical implementation guide.
