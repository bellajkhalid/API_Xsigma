# General Limitations

## Model Assumptions

The GSABR Interest Rate Volatility Model operates under several key assumptions that users must understand to properly apply the model and interpret its results:

### **Fundamental Market Assumptions**

1. **No Arbitrage Opportunities**: The market is assumed to be free of arbitrage opportunities. This assumption is fundamental to the derivation of the risk-neutral pricing framework.

2. **Frictionless Trading**: Trading is assumed to occur without transaction costs, bid-ask spreads, or other market frictions that could affect pricing.

3. **Continuous Trading**: The model assumes that trading can occur continuously, which may not reflect actual market conditions, especially during periods of market stress.

4. **Perfect Liquidity**: The model assumes that all instruments can be traded at their theoretical fair value without market impact.

### **Model-Specific Assumptions**

1. **Single Forward Rate Dynamics**: Each GSABR model instance describes the dynamics of a single forward rate (LIBOR or swap rate) independently of others.

2. **Stochastic Volatility Framework**: The model assumes that volatility follows a specific stochastic process with correlation to the underlying forward rate.

3. **Local Volatility Parametrization**: The GSABR Beta Mixture model uses a specific parametric form for the local volatility function, which may not capture all possible market behaviors.

4. **Short-Time Expansion Validity**: The model relies on short-time expansion approximations, which may become less accurate for very long-dated options.

## Model Limitations

### **1. Limited Control Over CMS Prices**

**Description**: The accuracy of Constant Maturity Swap (CMS) prices depends heavily on the goodness of fit of the additional parameters in the local volatility function.

**Impact**: 
- CMS pricing may be less accurate than vanilla swaption pricing
- Structured products with CMS components may exhibit pricing inconsistencies
- Hedging strategies involving CMS instruments may be suboptimal

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Enhanced calibration procedures specifically for CMS instruments
- Regular validation against CMS market prices
- Use of CMS-specific adjustments and corrections

### **2. Independent Dynamics Across Expiries**

**Description**: Each expiry/tenor combination is modeled independently, lacking a consistent term structure across forward rates.

**Impact**:
- Potential arbitrage opportunities between different expiries
- Inconsistent forward rate evolution assumptions
- Difficulties in pricing path-dependent instruments

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Cross-expiry consistency checks during calibration
- Term structure smoothing techniques
- Regular monitoring of inter-expiry relationships

### **3. Parameter Stability Issues**

**Description**: Model parameters may become unstable under extreme market conditions or when fitting to poor-quality market data.

**Impact**:
- Unreliable pricing during market stress
- Difficulty in risk management during volatile periods
- Potential for large parameter jumps between calibration cycles

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Parameter bounds and constraints during calibration
- Regularization techniques to promote parameter stability
- Stress testing and scenario analysis

### **4. Extrapolation Limitations**

**Description**: The model's behavior outside the calibrated strike and expiry ranges may be unreliable.

**Impact**:
- Inaccurate pricing for deep out-of-the-money options
- Unreliable risk calculations for extreme scenarios
- Potential for non-economic behavior in tail regions

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Conservative extrapolation methods
- Regular validation against available market data
- Use of alternative models for extreme strikes

## **Numerical and Computational Limitations**

### **1. PDE Discretization Errors**

**Description**: ZABR models using PDE methods are subject to discretization errors from finite difference schemes.

**Impact**:
- Pricing accuracy depends on grid size and time step selection

### **2. Calibration Convergence Issues**

**Description**: Optimization algorithms may fail to converge or converge to local minima.

**Impact**:
- Suboptimal parameter estimates
- Inconsistent calibration results
- Increased computational time

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Multiple starting points for optimization
- Robust optimization algorithms
- Parameter initialization heuristics

### **3. Computational Performance**

**Description**: Complex models require significant computational resources, especially for real-time applications.

**Impact**:
- Slower pricing and risk calculation
- Scalability issues for large portfolios
- Higher infrastructure costs

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Model approximations for real-time use
- Parallel computing implementations
- Caching and pre-computation strategies

### **2. Calibration Instrument Selection**

**Description**: The choice of instruments used for calibration significantly affects model performance.

**Impact**:

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Diverse calibration instrument sets
- Out-of-sample validation
- Regular calibration review and updates

### **3. Market Regime Changes**

**Description**: The model may not adapt quickly to fundamental changes in market structure or behavior.

**Impact**:
