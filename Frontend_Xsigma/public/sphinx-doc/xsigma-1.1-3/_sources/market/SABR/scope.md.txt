# Scope and Use

## Overview

The **GSABR Interest Rate Volatility Model** is designed for use in pricing and risk management of vanilla interest rate options, where the underlying is a standard LIBOR rate or swap rate. It provides forward prices for specific instruments based on key inputs such as the forward of the underlying, expiry, tenor, strike, and model parameters. The model relies on a combination of theoretical approximations and numerical solving techniques to deliver accurate results.

### **Direct Applications**

The primary direct application of the GSABR model is in the marking and risk management of **caplets** and **swaptions**. These vanilla interest rate options are priced using the volatility smile generated by the model, enabling precise valuation and hedging.

### **Indirect Applications**

Beyond its direct use, the GSABR model plays a critical role in several indirect contexts:

1. **CMS (Constant Maturity Swap) and Structured Vanilla Trades**:
   - Provides an implied probability distribution for LIBOR and swap rates, which is essential for pricing structured products such as:
     - Non-callable range accruals.
     - Conditional spread options.
     - Other CMS-related trades.

2. **Exotic Trades**:
   - Serves as a foundation for calibrating more complex models, such as the **Libor Market Model (LMM)** and **short-rate models** (e.g., Cheyette).
   - Provides calibration targets for these models, ensuring consistency in pricing exotic derivatives.
   - Adjusts structured coupons and CMS components within exotic trades.

3. **Calibration for Exotic Models**:
   - Supplies swaption/caplet values used in the calibration of exotic models like **Cheyette** and **LMM**.
   - During the calibration process of other models, the GSABR model generates target prices (and/or implied volatilities) for instruments in the calibration set.

### **Model Classification**

The GSABR model is classified as **Tier 1**, indicating its high materiality and complexity. Its importance stems from its wide-ranging impact on both direct and indirect product pricing and risk management.

### **Dependencies on Other Models**

The GSABR model interacts with other models in the pricing and risk management ecosystem. Below is a summary of its dependencies:

| **CMD ID** | **Model Name**         | **Nature of Dependence**                              |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| CMD4014    | Black Prices           | Analytical payoff prices - Dependent                 |
| CMD3794    | Libor Market Model     | Term structure multi-factor model - Dependent        |
| CMD2258    | Cheyette Local Vol     | Local volatility short rate model - Dependent        |

#### **Explanation of Dependencies**

1. **Black Prices (CMD4014)**:
   - The GSABR model relies on Black's analytical formulas for pricing vanilla options. These formulas serve as a baseline for comparing and validating the results produced by the GSABR model.

2. **Libor Market Model (CMD3794)**:
   - The LMM is a term-structure multi-factor model that depends on the GSABR model for providing consistent calibration targets. The GSABR model ensures that the LMM accurately reflects market conditions.

3. **Cheyette Local Volatility Model (CMD2258)**:
   - The Cheyette model, a local volatility short-rate framework, uses the GSABR model to provide inputs for calibration and ensure consistency in pricing structured products.

### **Supported Instruments and Markets**

The GSABR model supports pricing and risk management for the following instruments:

#### **Primary Instruments**
- **European Swaptions**: Standard European-style options on interest rate swaps
- **Caplets/Floorlets**: Individual caps and floors on LIBOR rates
- **Digital Swaptions**: Binary payoff swaptions
- **CMS Caplets/Floorlets**: Caps and floors on constant maturity swap rates

#### **Secondary Applications**
- **Range Accruals**: Interest rate range accrual products
- **Spread Options**: Options on interest rate spreads
- **Callable Bonds**: Bond pricing with embedded call options
- **Structured Notes**: Complex structured interest rate products

#### **Market Coverage**
- **USD**: US Dollar interest rate markets (SOFR, USD LIBOR legacy)
- **EUR**: Euro interest rate markets (EURIBOR, ESTR)
- **GBP**: British Pound interest rate markets (SONIA, GBP LIBOR legacy)
- **JPY**: Japanese Yen interest rate markets (TONAR, JPY LIBOR legacy)
- **Other G10 Currencies**: Additional major currency markets as required

### **Model Limitations and Constraints**

#### **Theoretical Limitations**
1. **Single Forward Rate Modeling**: Each expiry/tenor combination requires a separate GSABR model instance
2. **No Term Structure Consistency**: Independent calibration across different expiries may lead to inconsistencies
3. **Local Volatility Approximation**: The model relies on short-time expansion approximations

#### **Practical Constraints**
1. **Calibration Stability**: Model parameters may become unstable in extreme market conditions
2. **Computational Complexity**: PDE-based implementations require significant computational resources
3. **Market Data Requirements**: Requires liquid market data across the volatility surface

#### **Risk Management Considerations**
1. **Model Risk**: Inherent uncertainty in model specification and parameter estimation
2. **Calibration Risk**: Risk of poor calibration leading to mispricing
3. **Extrapolation Risk**: Model behavior outside calibrated strike/expiry ranges may be unreliable

### **Regulatory and Compliance Framework**

The GSABR model operates within the following regulatory framework:

#### **Model Validation Requirements**
- **Independent Validation**: Regular independent validation of model performance
- **Backtesting**: Historical performance analysis and backtesting procedures
- **Stress Testing**: Evaluation under stressed market scenarios
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive model documentation and change control

#### **Risk Management Standards**
