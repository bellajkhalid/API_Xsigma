import { linkedinApi } from '@/services/linkedinApi';

const handleLinkedInLogin = () => {
  const authUrl = linkedinApi.getAuthUrl();
  window.location.href = authUrl;
};

// In your callback component
const handleCallback = async (code: string, state: string) => {
  try {
    await linkedinApi.exchangeCodeForToken(code, state);
    const profile = await linkedinApi.getProfile();
    console.log('LinkedIn profile:', profile);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('LinkedIn auth error:', error);
  }
};
```

### 2. Content Sharing

```typescript
// Share research updates
await linkedinApi.shareXSigmaUpdate({
  type: 'research',
  title: 'New Volatility Research Published',
  description: 'Our latest research shows 23% improvement in VIX prediction accuracy using ensemble methods.',
  url: 'https://xsigma.com/research/volatility-forecasting',
  hashtags: ['QuantitativeFinance', 'Research', 'Volatility', 'MachineLearning']

// Share product announcements
await linkedinApi.sharePost({
  text: 'Excited to announce our new real-time volatility API! 🚀 Sub-millisecond latency for SABR and Heston model calibration.',
  url: 'https://xsigma.com/api/volatility',
  title: 'XSigma Volatility API Launch',

});
```

### 3. Profile Synchronization

```typescript
// Get and display LinkedIn profile
const profile = await linkedinApi.getProfile();
