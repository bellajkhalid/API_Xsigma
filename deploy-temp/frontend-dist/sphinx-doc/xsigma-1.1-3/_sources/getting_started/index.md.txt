# Getting Started

## Introduction

Welcome to XSIGMA! We recommend that you start by reading [The XSIGMA
Book](https://book.xsigma.org), a comprehensive guide to XSIGMA that covers all
aspects of its functionality. Additionally, you may find it helpful to explore
the [XSIGMA Examples](https://examples.xsigma.org), a collection of useful reference
materials that demonstrate how to use XSIGMA's different modules and features.

Before diving into XSIGMA's functionality, ensure that your system meets its
[system requirements](#system-requirements). Depending on your programming
experience and needs, you can choose different programming languages to work
with XSIGMA. We have documentation on how to use XSIGMA with [Python](#using-python),
[Jupyter](#using-jupyter), [C++ and CMake](#using-c-and-cmake),
[Javascript](#using-javascript), and [WebAssembly](#using-webassembly).

Lastly, to help address your specific needs, you may also consider exploring
existing free and open-source [frameworks or applications](#using-existing-frameworks-and-applications)
that already leverage XSIGMA. These frameworks and applications can be extended and customized to work
for specific use cases and may provide ready-to-use solutions for your project.
