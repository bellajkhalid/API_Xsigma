Table 4: Model risk assessment for DBOPT-RatesMarketAFSABR_FXMarket_EquityBlackScholes_CorrelationSkew

The uncertainty rating has been determined based on consideration of model inputs, relevant model limitations, the risk factor representation required for the products being modelled, the nature of the numerical implementation number and nature of risk factors modelled including their interdependencies on consideration of the the mathematical specification of the model and where relevant, the calibration approach employed, the environment of which the model is part. The reliance of all pricing models is high as the model outputs define the relevant officially reported metrics rather than merely informing them. Reduction of reliance on pricing model outputs is similarly inappropriate.

## i Summary of main validation results

The model DBOPT-CorrelationSkew is a pricing models used for the following purposes: Generate asset and liability fair value measurements reported in official books and records and/or generate risk sensitivities (i.e. for End of

Day risk management purpose and/or trading Risk and Capital calculation) and re-price positions under stress scenarios as a servicer model, in the context of regulatory estimates (CCAR costs i.e. CCAR), in the Interest Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB), Delta EVE Simulation or in the context of full revaluation ("Full Revar") of (Stress), Value at Risk (HistrSim, SVAR). The model is developed and maintained by DBAnalytics and is provided via dlls for use in Microsoft Excel, Python, Perl, and is made available in Kannon and Risk Engine (amend as required).

The DBOPT model is an analytic and single horizon Monte Carlo model implementation that can be used for pricing derivatives on one or two underlyings that set at the same date. The model uses an AFSABR model for IR vol and PFV vol for FX, EQ and Asset.

The models represent variations using two underlyings out of IR/EQ/FX/Asset where the underlying marginals are directly derived from market volatilities. The joint distribution of the 2 underlyings is modeled by a correlation skew copula.

The purpose of the CorrelationSkew model is to price accurately 2D payoffs and capture the correlation evi-denced by the skew of a correlation skew that is not rich enough to match the market of dual digitals at different strike. A naive parametric correlation model is necessary to capture the correlation skew evidenced by duale digitale at various strikes. The corr skew model provides document gives more flexibility for a rich corr skew surface. One non parametric variations is tested in this document: TermSkew(TS).

The model is appropriate for 2D payoff with underlyings setting at the same date such as dual digitals and contingent options.
For path dependent correlation products such as callable dual digitals, the dynamic DBX correlation skew model should be used instead. Model configurations is:

• TERMSKEW (TS): a copula approach using MC simulations

| AFCOMPLUND[AUTO]:: FULLDRIVER | [17628] | (NO) | | DiffuseFullDriver can take value Yes or No (default). When it is set to Yes all the underlying in the driver are diffused. If it is set to no just the underlying needed for the security pricing are diffused and the driver is reduced accordingly. No changes are done on the forward driver performance. |
| AFCOMPLUND[AUTO]:: SkewConvexityType | [17666] | (STANDARD) | | Allows the user to set a non-standard definition of SKEW and SMILE. Currently, this is avail-able when SkewType is equal to SMILE and MULAFAD. For SARR3FORMULAFAD, it can be STANDARD (the default value) or SARR3. The default (and only al-lowed value) for all other skew param-eterisations is STANDARD. |

This affects how we pick up the correlation for the first it-eration of the Jacobian search when TERMSKEW copula. NO can lead to instabilities in case of steep cor-relation skew. DBAnalytics research paper 9420 gives an exact definition of this parameter. |
| CURVE: AveragingConvex-ity | [17778] | (VOL) | | Possible values are VOL (default) or FUNDINGVOL. VOL: when calculating WAVG rates with DBOPT model (typically 1B WAVG OIS), convexity is calculated with all inputted vols (DBOPTVOL and FUNDINGVOL). FUNDINGVOL: when calculating WAVG rates with DBOPT model (typically 1B WAVG OIS), convexity is calculated with FUNDINGVOL. |

When deriving the annuity mapping func-tion, we need to get the conditional expectation of funding ADP w.r.t. the LIBOR short rate. Currently we use the DS4 Monte Carlo with the PolyOrder and StaleMaxFraction to get the conditional expectation. Defaults are PolyOrder : 1200, StaleMaxFrac-tion : 0.25 |

APPROX : when PLAINZERO SECURITY has non zero Rein-vestSpread and/or Spread, calculate con-vexity by approximating as if the non zero yield were coming from LIBOR com-pounding.

## 2 Introduction to Model and Validation

### 2.1 Validation Scope

The scope of the validation is detailed in section 1.1.

Products with similar features from a valuation perspective are grouped together and tested as a single consistent group wherein testing consistency a representative product are deemed applicable and able to confer equivalent inference to the whole product group. The product grouping logic is presented in section 2.2.

### 2.2 Product Description

Below is the list of product definitions for the models:

• DBOPT-RateDeterministic_FXMarket_AssetMarket_CorrelationSkew
• DBOPT-RateDeterministic_EquityBlackScholes_AssetMarket_CorrelationSkew
• DBOPT-RatesMarketAFSABR_FXMarket_EquityBlackScholes_CorrelationSkew

| Product Name (Long Product Name) | Product Description |
| --- | --- |
| HybMultiDigital | In the 2D scope of this document, this product pays a fixed coupon if 2 digital conditions are met at expiry. In the 1D scope of this document, this product pays a Euro-pean option payout on the condition that a digital is breached by another underlying at expiry. In particular, the HybContingentOptMultiAssetBasket can cor-respond to a contingent swaption. In this case, the payoff is a physically or cash settled swaption that can only payoff if based if another asset (FX, Equity or IR) is above and/or below given barriers. The SECURITY used to represent this payoff is ASWAPTION. The usual ASWAPTION flags are used to define the underlying swaption. The extra condition to exercise the payoff are defined with a trigger subtable in the ASWAPTION security. The contingent swaption pricer is activated when TriggerType = SPOT. The swaption has to be a vanilla one: bullet and have only one exercise date. |
| HybContingentOptMultiAssetBasket | |

#### 2.2.1 Contingent Swaption

We call a contingent swaption a swaption that can only be exercised if some range condition is met on another underlying. The payoff of a player contingent swaption has the general form

$$V_T = A_T_F (S_T - K)^+ \cdot 1_{L<X_T<U}$$

The swaption can either be:

• cash-settled
  - in which case the annuity in the above formula is the cash-settled annuity function
  - OptionType = CashPut (Call/Straddle)
• physically-settled
  - in which case the annuity is the PV01 of the underlying swap
  - OptionType = OISPut (Call/Straddle)

The index condition can be an EQUITY, a CMS, a LIBOR, an FXRATE or an ASSET.
This kind of contingent swaption is priced in DBOPT within the SIMCOPULA framework and the swaption has to be bullet and in order for the swaption to be bullet, the Notional needs to be constant.

• no Cashflows subtables with non-constant notionals
• StrikeType shouldn't be set to COMPOUNDNOTIONAL

##### 2.2.1.1 Physically-settled Swaptions

For a physically-settled payer swaption, if the swap rate between time T and as seen at time T is denoted $S(T, T, T + \tau)$, the value can be denoted

$$A(0, T, T + \tau) \cdot E^{Q_A}[\max(S(T, T, T + \tau) - K, 0)]$$

where $A(0, T, T + \tau)$ is the annuity of the swap as seen at time 0.
The implied volatility used to price such swaptions can be directly read off from the input VOL (perhaps after performing volatility-conversions).

##### 2.2.1.2 Single rate payoffs priced via replication

Suppose we want to price a function $f(S)$ of the swap rate $S(T, T, T + \tau)$ as seen at time T', paid at T_p. The valuation in the T_p forward and annuity measures can be written

$$E^{Q_T_p}[f(S)] = \frac{A(0, T, T + \tau)}{P(0, T_p)} \cdot E^{Q_A} \left[ f(S) \frac{P(T, T_p)}{A(T, T, T + \tau)} \right]$$ (1)

• Annuity mapping assumption

The expectation (1) cannot be computed without further assumptions because $\frac{P(T, T_p)}{A(T, T, T + \tau)}$ is not a function of the swap rate S_F and in the annuity measure Q_A only the swap rate distribution is known from the physically settled swaption prices. We define the function

$$G_{T_p} (S) = E^{Q_A} \left[ \frac{P(T, T_p)}{A(T, T, T + \tau)} | S_F = S \right]$$

so that the general pricing formula can be written (this is just a formal projection of $\frac{L(T, T_F)}{A(0, T, T + \tau)}$ onto S_F so this is still an exact formula) as

$$E^{Q_A}[G_{T_p}(S)f(S)]$$ (2)

This shows that any payoff that is a function of a single swap rate (this will typically be a single rate CMS payoff or a cash-settled swaption) can be priced using (2) provided the annuity function G_{T_p} is known.
The function G_{T_p} is called the Annuity Mapping Function and several choices for this function are available in DBOPT.
The label AnnuityMappingModel in DBOPTVOL decides which of the different annuity mapping function is used:

• AnnuityMappingModel= Deterministic: is a method historically used by the industry where the cash DVD1 is calculated with the swap rate observed now. Though this is market practice for quoting swaption prices, it is not strictly correct (i.e. if there is convexity from curve dynamics).
• AnnuityMappingModel=SHORTRATE: calculates the annuity mapping function with the Hull-White model whose vola physical swaption Vol from the DBOPTVOL and a flat mean reversion through the MEANREV subtable of the DBOPTVOL (mandatory input).

##### 2.2.1.3 Cash-settled Swaptions

The value of a cash-settled payer swaption is

$$E^{Q_T} [A_{CS}(S_T_p)(S_T_p - K)^+]$$

where $A_{CS}(S)$ is the cash-settled annuity function which depends on the tenor T' of the swap and the frequency of the fixed leg re:

$$A_{CS}(S) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{S}{n})^i}$$

This is an example of (1) with $f(S) = A_{CS}(S)(S - K)^+$.
For cash-settled receiver swaptions the payoff is $f(S) = A_{CS}(S)(K - S)^+$.

## 2.3 Model Description

### 2.3.1 Model Parameters and Market Inputs

In this section, we give an overview of the market inputs and the main model parameters.
The model parameters are more detailed in section 4.6.2.

#### 2.3.1.1 Model parameters

• DBOPT:
  - NumberSims: NumberSims controls the number of Monte Carlo simulations in SIMCOPULA pricer, i.e. when CoputaMethod=SIMCOPULA. The default value is 2000.
  - Seed: Seed is an integer for the monte carlo random number generator. Cycling this value over different integers gives an idea of the seed variance associated with a given product.
  - NumberSeedVarianceRuns: When NumberSeedVarianceRuns is greater than one, the total number of Monte Carlo simulations is NumberSims * NumberSeedVarianceRuns * NumberSims.

• CoputaMethod: CoputaMethod must be set to SIMCOPULA for this model.
• Correlation:
  - TermSkewMaxIter: TermSkewMaxIter specifies the number of iterations that are used to produce the pairwise underlying values obtained through the correlation skew model.
  - TermSkewSmoothing: TermSkewSmoothing must be set to YES to improve risk stability in presence of a steep correlation skew.
  - InterpType: InterpType defines the method used for interpolation in time between two CorrelationSkewTargets matrices. It defaults to LINEAR.
  - CorrelationInterpolationSpace: The correlation object used with CorrelationInterpolationSpace = TERMSKEW can be used for DBOPT SIMCOPULA (CoputaMethod = SIMCOPULA) model.
  - QuantoCorrelationInterpolationSpace: QuantoCorrelationInterpolationSpace is only relevant when pricing a trade with quanto and CorrelationInterpolationSpace != TIME. For now, only QuantoCorrelationInterpolationSpace = TIME is allowed. This means that the quanto adjustment is not computed from the correlation skew parameters.

#### 2.3.1.2 Market inputs

• Domestic (and foreign) interest rates curves and volatilities
• FX spot and volatility
• Equity spot, repo forward curve and a schedule of discrete dividends and continuous dividends and volatility
• Correlation values

### 2.3.2 DBOPT

The DBOPT model is an analytic and single horizon Monte Carlo model implementation that can be used for pricing derivatives on one or two underlyings that set at the same date.

### 2.3.3 Model inputs - Calibration

An example of calibration instrument is dual digitals. In this case, model inputs are Gaussian implied correlations for dual digitals.
Let's consider an example where the calibration instruments are 4 dual digitals. This translates into the following Gaussian implied correlations.
Targets:

|   | 0.60% | 1.20% |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3000 | 9.53% | 23.58% |
| 3600 | 12.43% | 61.30% |

Figure 2: Example of inputs: Gaussian implied correlations for dual digitals

The DBOPT model TERMSKEW can then be calibrated to match the four dual digitals above. This translates into a correlation skew grid.
TERMSKEW:

|   | 0.60% | 1.20% |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3000 | 6.63% | 20.00% |
| 3600 | -5.92% | 84.81% |

Figure 3: Correlation skew grid - TS

If we plot the correlation skew for a grid of dual digitals, we obtain the following interpolations:
TERMSKEW:

|   | 0.20% | 0.40% | 0.60% | 0.80% | 1.00% | 1.20% | 1.40% | 1.80% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2600 | 7.51% | 7.61% | 9.31% | 13.16% | 18.03% | 21.71% | 22.44% | 21.83% |
| 2800 | 7.51% | 7.66% | 9.52% | 13.78% | 18.18% | 22.13% | 22.81% | 22.04% |
| 3000 | 7.24% | 7.64% | 9.53% | 14.28% | 19.31% | 23.58% | 24.34% | 23.38% |
| 3200 | 6.07% | 6.90% | 10.19% | 18.16% | 27.20% | 34.07% | 35.46% | 34.34% |
| 3400 | 5.08% | 6.14% | 11.15% | 23.32% | 37.18% | 47.93% | 50.40% | 49.48% |
| 3600 | 4.23% | 5.90% | 12.43% | 28.01% | 46.41% | 61.30% | 66.74% | 67.33% |
| 3800 | 2.28% | 3.89% | 10.22% | 25.14% | 42.88% | 59.46% | 69.26% | 73.13% |
| 4000 | 0.48% | 1.66% | 8.00% | 22.46% | 35.82% | 51.35% | 63.64% | 70.71% |

### 2.3.4 Factor based correlation skew copula (TermSkew)

#### 2.3.4.1 Introduction

The aim of this copula is to produce a correlation skew that is intuitive and can easily be calibrated to dual callaques or dual digitals. A requirement from the business is to have a sticky strike correlation skew. This correlation skew copula is constructed using a Monte Carlo numerical technique.

#### 2.3.4.2 2d copula

Model parameters of this model are a 2d grid of pairwise correlations like quantiles that are a function of the two underlying $s_i(L_i, U_i)$. Interpolation is linear on a grid of input values. The following pathwise Cholesky decomposition from independent normal deviates $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ is applied, where $\rho_0 = \rho(ATM_1, ATM_1)$:

$$X_1^{(1)} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \rho_0}{2}} Z_1 + \sqrt{\frac{1 - \rho_0}{2}} Z_2$$ (3)

$$X_2^{(1)} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \rho_0}{2}} Z_1 - \sqrt{\frac{1 - \rho_0}{2}} Z_2$$ (4)

In this first iteration, $X_1^{(1)}$ and $X_2^{(1)}$ are gaussian hence can easily be mapped into uniform deviates $U_1^{(1)}$ and $U_2^{(1)}$. By construction these uniform deviates $U_1^{(1)}$ and $U_2^{(1)}$ follow a gaussian copula of parameter $\rho_0$. The underlying marginals are then applied

$$A_i^{(1)} = F_i^{-1}(U_i^{(1)})$$ (5)

Cumulative distribution functions $F_i(x)$ of each underlying under the payment measure are assumed to be known and inversible. $A_1^{(1)}$ and $A_2^{(2)}$ are pathwise underlying values that follow a gaussian copula of parameter $\rho_0$.
Pathwise $\rho_0 = \rho(A_1^{(1)}, A_2^{(1)})$ is then defined and the same mapping as above is applied to obtain $X^{(2)}, U^{(2)}$ and $A^{(2)}$:

$$X_1^{(2)} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \rho_1}{2}} Z_1 + \sqrt{\frac{1 - \rho_1}{2}} Z_2$$ (6)

$$X_2^{(2)} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \rho_1}{2}} Z_1 - \sqrt{\frac{1 - \rho_1}{2}} Z_2$$ (7)

From this second iteration, $X_1^{(2)}$ and $X_2^{(2)}$ are not gaussian. To map them into uniform deviates, a simple numerical approach is to take the ranks of simulated $X_1^{(2)}$ and $X_2^{(2)}$ when sorting them in ascending order.

$$U_i^{(2)} = \frac{rank X_i^{(2)}}{N_{sims}} - 0.5$$ (8)

$$A_i^{(2)} = F_i^{-1}(U_i^{(2)})$$ (9)

By construction $A_1^{(2)}$ and $A_2^{(2)}$ are pathwise underlying values that follow a valid copula model.
$\rho_2$ and $\rho_3$ are kept the same for all iterations. TermSkewMaxIter specifies the number of iterations. Even with TermSkewMax-Iter=1, the model defines a valid correlation skew copula.

#### 2.3.4.3 Implementation

CorrelationInterpolationSpace=TERMSKEW
TS uses CoputaMethod=SIMCOPULA, hence corresponding to MC simulations for a single horizon date.
When not specified, TS uses TermSkewMaxIter=3 and 50K simulations.

#### 2.3.4.4 Comments

• The model was defined iteratively because of the desired definition of correlation as a function of underlying levels $\rho_0 = \rho(x_1, x_2)$ can be defined and no further iteration is required.
• The model was defined and MC to keep intuitive notations, but a 2D integration grid could be used. As will be shown in this document, using SIMCOPULA instead of 2D integration only has a limited impact on stability as only a single simulation date is considered unlike typical MC engines like DBX.

### 2.5.1 Bug fix: SIMCOPULA when pricing a Quanto RangeSwap: R_500_46

#### 2.5.1.1 Model Change Description

Previously, the marginals of the underlying were not adjusted when needed and thus didn't take into account quanto adjustment.

Now the quanto adjustment of marginals is computed using the non skew correlation information separately given to the CORR object. To avoid ambiguity by having both skew and non-skew information (CorrelationInterpolationSpace)(TIME, default is same value as CorrelationInterpolationSpace) has been introduced and pricing with TIME has been enabled.

Setting it to TIME means that the quanto adjustment of the marginals uses a flat correlation (GaussianFCopula) and fakes the correlation found in the CorrelationMatrix matrices of the CORR object. The correlation skew (if any) is only used to build the copula. This means the matrices setting would be a small inconsistency when there is also correlation skew for the underlying should be careful that the QuantoCorrelationMatrix are somewhat close the the average value of the underlying correlation skew. If QuantoCorrelationInterpolationSpace is not set to TIME and there is correlation skew, then the pricing will throw an error.

#### 2.5.1.2 Quanto Rangeswap with Correlation Skew: Pricing Process

We describe here the pricing process of a Quanto Rangeswap with Correlation Skew.

##### 2.5.1.2.1 Quanto pricing

A Quanto product is one where a rate R denoted in one currency d is paid in another currency f. Suppose the payoff in question is denoted f(R) paying at time T_p. We denote by $Q_T$ and $Q_T^f$ the T_p forward measures in currencies d and f respectively. We denote by $X(t)$ the FX rate f/d at time t. The value (denominated in f) of our payoff can be written

$$DF^f(0, T_p) \cdot E^{Q_T^f}[f(R)] = \frac{1}{X_0} DF^d(0, T_p) \cdot E^{Q_T}[X(T_p)f(R)]$$

Let's consider the case of a domestic asset paid in the f currency. The payoff at time T is $S^d(T) \cdot 1_f$. Converted to the domestic currency, the payoff in the domestic currency writes

$$V_T^d = DF^d(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_T^d}[S^d(T)X(T)]$$

The choice in DBA is to proceed in the payment measure $Q_T^f$, so the payoff computed is

$$X_0 \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_T^f}[S^d(T)]$$

So the idea is to compute the quanto marginal: the distribution of S under the payment measure $Q_T^f$.

##### 2.5.1.2.2 Generating the quanto marginal

Note that a standard Gaussian copula is always used to generate the quanto marginal. The flat correlations input in the model at this stage:
The annuity measure $E^{Q_T^f}[S^d(T)]$ which is equivalent to knowing $E^{Q_T^f}[S^d(T)X(T)]$ so the idea is to know the marginal distributions of $S^d$ and $X^{-d}$ under the domestic measure $Q_T^d$. This is straightforward:

• Option prices on $S^d$ paid in d give the S marginal in the domestic measure: $F_S^d(x_1)$
• Similarly, the FX vol surface gives the X marginal in the domestic measure: $F_X^d(x_2)$
• Then, the standard Gaussian copula (flat correlations input) is used to compute the joint distribution: $F^d(x_1, x_2) = C^d(F_S^d(x_1), F_X^d(x_2))$
• Then, pricing puts/digital puts on the quantoed underlying $E^{Q_T^d}[X(T)1_{S(T)<K}]$ using $F^d(x_1, x_2)$ gives the quanto marginal: $F_T^f$, the distribution of $S^d$ under the payment measure $Q_T^f$

All the steps described above use 1D/2D integration.

##### 2.5.1.2.3 Pricing the quanto payoff

• As described above, the pricing is done in the payment measure where the $F_T^f$ is now available.
• Obtaining the distribution of X in the payment measure $F_X^f$ is also straightforward.
• At this step, when pricing the payoff, any correlation skew input will be used.

The three ingredients above give the joint distribution under the payment measure $F^f(x_1, x_2) = C(F_T^f(x_1), F_X^f(x_2))$. The pricing of the payoff on the quantoed underlying is now straightforward.
The payoff computation uses SIMCOUPLA so Monte Carlo methods.

#### 2.5.1.2.4 Quanto payoff example: a quanto single digital

We consider the quanto single digital paying at time T

$$1_X(T)>L_X \cdot 1_S(T)>L_S$$

This amount in paid in the foreign currency f.
Let's consider the following trace:

• domestic currency d is EUR, payment currency f
• Maturity is 1Y, Notional = 10k, L_S = 3640 and L_X = 1.22
• FX rate: X is equal to one unit of domestic currency d in payment currency f
• S is a domestic equity underlying EUR STOXX.

The price in the domestic currency writes

$$V_0 = \frac{1}{X_0} \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_f^T}[1_X(T)>L_X \cdot 1_S(T)>L_S]$$

So what is needed here is the distribution of S under the payment forward measure $Q_T^f$. The distribution of X under $Q_T^f$ is straightforward as X is the value in f of one unit of d.
Similarly to the computation above $F_S^d(x_1), F_X^d(x_2)$ and the standard Gaussian copula give the quanto marginal $F_S^f(x)$.
Given $F_S^f(x_1), F_X^f(x_2)$ and the correlation skew give the price V_0.

## 2.5.1.3 Convergence Test

In this section we test the convergence of the Monte Carlo pricer for the quanto digital. We check the convergence of the quanto digital price. We compute the error caused by seed variance $(Error = \frac{StdDev(Replications)}{MeanPrice})$. Tests pass if ratio declines rapidly when NumberSims increases.

![Figure 5: Price Convergence](./Fig/5.png)

Test passes as the Error decreases when NumberSims increases.

## 2.5.1.4 Equity Spot Stress Test

### 2.5.1.4.1 Price Stability

As the Equity spot increases, the KO probability decreases, and the price should increase.

![Figure 6: Stability - Price - EQ Spot relative shift](./Fig/6.png)

Test passes as the price increases when increasing the Equity spot.

### 2.5.1.4.2 Equity Delta Stability

The Equity Delta should change smoothly when shifting the Equity spot and its behaviour should be in line with the behaviour of the price when shifting the Equity Spot.

![Figure 7: Stability - Equity Delta - EQ Spot relative shift](./Fig/7.png)

Test passes as, when shifting the Equity Spot, the Equity Delta varies smoothly and its behaviour is in line with the price behaviour:
- The trade being initially OTM, a negative shift of the Equity spot, gives a zero price, accordingly the Equity Delta is equal to zero
- when increasing the spot, the trade gets ITM, the price increases, the Equity delta is positive accordingly
- for higher spot values, the price increase flattens, the Equity delta decreases accordingly

## 2.5.1.5 FX Spot Stress Test

### 2.5.1.5.1 Price Stability

As the FX spot increases, the KO probability decreases, and the price should increase. For higher FX spot values, there's no impact of the KO barrier anymore but given that the price writes 

$$V_0^d = \frac{1}{X_0} \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_f}_T[1_{X(T)>L_X} \cdot 1_{S(T)>L_S}]$$

increasing the FX spot should decrease the price.

![Figure 8: Stability - Price - FX Spot relative shift](./Fig/8.png)

Test passes as the price increases when increasing the FX spot and decreases for higher FX spot values.

### 2.5.1.5.2 FX Delta Stability

The FX Delta should change smoothly when shifting the Equity spot and its behaviour should be in line with the price behaviour when shifting the Equity spot.

![Figure 9: Stability - FX Delta - FX Spot relative shift](./Fig/9.png)

Test passes as, when shifting the FX spot, the FX Delta varies smoothly and its behaviour is in line with the price behaviour:
- The trade being initially OTM, a negative shift of the FX spot, gives a zero price, accordingly the FX Delta is equal to zero
- when increasing the spot, the trade gets ITM, the price increases, the FX delta is positive accordingly
- for higher spot values, the price decreases, the FX delta gets negative accordingly

## 2.5.1.6 FX PIV - ATM Vol Stress Test

### 2.5.1.6.1 Expected Price Behaviour when shifting FX ATM Vol

The trade we're considering is a quanto dual single digital where the price writes:

$$V_0^d = \frac{1}{X_0} \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_f}_T[1_{X(T)>L_X} \cdot 1_{S(T)>L_S}]$$

In order to understand the expected price behaviour when shifting FX ATM Vol, we start by considering 2 simpler trades:
- Quanto single digital on Equity: the payoff writes $1_{S(T)>L_S}$ paid in $f$.
- Single digital on FX: the payoff writes $1_{X(T)>L_X}$ paid in $f$.

So that we have the following 3 trades with the following prices:
- Quanto single digital on Equity:

$$V_0^{d,EQ} = \frac{1}{X_0} \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_f}_T[1_{S(T)>L_S}]$$

- Single digital on FX:

$$V_0^{d,FX} = \frac{1}{X_0} \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_f}_T[1_{X(T)>L_X}]$$

- Quanto dual single digital on Equity and FX:

$$V_0^d = \frac{1}{X_0} \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_f}_T[1_{X(T)>L_X} \cdot 1_{S(T)>L_S}]$$

In order to describe the prices behaviours w.r.t the FX ATM Vol, we consider the following Black & Scholes setting:
The Equity dynamics under the domestic risk-neutral measure $Q^d$ write
$$\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r^d dt + \sigma dW_t^d$$

The FX dynamics of $X_t$, the value of one unit of $d$ in $f$, under the foreign risk-neutral measure $Q^f$, write
$$\frac{dX_t}{X_t} = (r^f - r^d)dt + \sigma_X dW_t^f$$

with flat correlation $d < W^d, W^f >_t = \rho dt$

- Quanto single digital on Equity: Expected Price Behaviour when shifting FX ATM Vol

$$V_0^{d,EQ} = \frac{1}{X_0} \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_f}_T[1_{S(T)>L_S}] = \frac{1}{X_0} \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_f}[\frac{1}{X(T)} \cdot 1_{S(T)>L_S}]$$

Back from forward measures $Q_T$ to risk-neutral measures $Q$ we can write
$$E^{Q_f}[1_{S(T)>L_S}] = E^{Q^f}[\frac{B^f(0)}{B^f(T)} \cdot \frac{B^f(T)}{B^f(0)} \cdot \frac{X_0}{X(T)} \cdot 1_{S(T)>L_S}]$$

which gives the Radon-Nikodym derivative
$$\frac{dQ^f}{dQ^d} = \frac{B^f(T)}{B^f(0)} \cdot \frac{X(0)}{X(T)}$$

which gives the Numeraire corresponding to the foreign measure $Q^f$ as $N^f(t) = \frac{B^f(t)}{X(t)}$

which gives the $Q^f$-brownian motion $W^{f,S}$ as 
$$dW_t^{f,S} = dW_t^d - \frac{d < N^f, W^d >_t}{N^f(t)} = dW_t^d + \rho\sigma_X dt$$

which gives the Equity dynamics under the foreign measure $Q^f$ as
$$\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = (r^d - \rho\sigma_X \sigma)dt + \sigma dW_t^{f,S}$$

We can now write the probability under the foreign measure 
$$E^{Q_f}[1_{S(T)>L_S}] = N(\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}(ln(\frac{S_0}{L_S}) + (r^d - \rho\sigma_X\sigma - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)T))$$

As we're interested in the behaviour w.r.t $\sigma_X$ - everything else kept constant - we rewrite the probability as follows
$$E^{Q_f}[1_{S(T)>L_S}] = N(f(\sigma_X))$$

where 
$$f(\sigma_X) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}(ln(\frac{S_0}{L_S}) + (r^d - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)T) - \rho\sigma_X \sqrt{T}$$

In order to study $f(\sigma_X)$ we neglect the rates impact considering zero rates, it then rewrites
$$f(\sigma_X) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}(ln(\frac{S_0}{L_S}) - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2T) - \rho\sigma_X \sqrt{T}$$

$f's$ derivative w.r.t $\sigma_X$ writes
$$f'(\sigma_X) = -\rho\sqrt{T}$$

$f'(\sigma_X)$ has minus the sign of correlation. In the trade used for testing, we're considering a negative correlation $\rho = -0.1$, thus in this case, $f'(\sigma_X) = -\rho\sqrt{T} > 0$.

and the limits w.r.t $\sigma_X$ write
$$lim_{\sigma_X \rightarrow +\infty}f(\sigma_X) = +\infty$$
$$lim_{\sigma_X \rightarrow -\infty}f(\sigma_X) = f(0) < 0$$

because the trade is initially OTM: $ln(\frac{S_0}{L_S}) < 0$ Thus $N(f(\sigma_X))$ should increase from $N(f(0)) < \frac{1}{2}$ to 1.

In order to consider a price that looks like a probability, we choose the nominal equal to $X_0$ in order to compensate for the multiplication by $\frac{1}{X_0}$. Thus the price of the Quanto single digital on Equity, in this case of zero rates and $X_0$ Notional, writes
$$V_0^{d,EQ} = N(f(\sigma_X))$$

and should increase from $N(f(0)) < \frac{1}{2}$ to 1.

- Single digital on FX: Expected Price Behaviour when shifting FX ATM Vol

$$V_0^{d,FX} = \frac{1}{X_0} \cdot DF^f(0, T) \cdot E^{Q_f}_T[1_{X(T)>L_X}]$$

This price is straightforward as the dynamics of $X$ are already under the $Q^f$-measure.
$$E^{Q_f}_T[1_{X(T)>L_X}] = N(f_X(\sigma_X))$$

where 
$$f_X(\sigma_X) = (ln(\frac{X_0}{L_X}) + (r^f - r^d)T) \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma_X \sqrt{T}} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_X \sqrt{T}$$

Neglecting interest rates, it rewrites
$$f_X(\sigma_X) = ln(\frac{X_0}{L_X}) \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma_X \sqrt{T}} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_X \sqrt{T}$$

so that
$$f_X'(\sigma_X) = -ln(\frac{X_0}{L_X}) \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma_X^2 \sqrt{T}} - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{T}$$

and the limits write
$$lim_{\sigma_X \rightarrow +\infty}f_X(\sigma_X) = -\infty$$
$$lim_{\sigma_X \rightarrow -\infty}f_X(\sigma_X) = -\infty$$

because the trade is initially OTM: $ln(\frac{X_0}{L_X}) < 0$.
Thus $N(f_X(\sigma_X))$ will increase from 0 to a value that is lower than $\frac{1}{2}$, $f_X(\sigma_X)$ being negative in this case. Then $N(f_X(\sigma_X))$ will decrease from that value to 0.
Back to the digital price, considering again zero rates and $X_0$ Notional, it writes
$$V_0^{d,FX} = N(f_X(\sigma_X))$$

- Quanto dual single digital on Equity and FX: Again considering zero rates and $X_0$ Notional, the price writes
$$V_0^d = E^{Q_f}_T[1_{X(T)>L_X} \cdot 1_{S(T)>L_S}]$$

In order to plot the corresponding figure, we multiply the $X_0$ Notional by 10,000 so that the 3 trades we're considering have the following prices:
- Quanto single digital on Equity:
$$V_0^{d,EQ} = 10,000 \cdot N(f(\sigma_X))$$
and should increase from under 5k to 10k.
- Single digital on FX:
$$V_0^{d,FX} = 10,000 \cdot N(f_X(\sigma_X))$$
and should increase from 0 to under 5k and then decrease back to 0.
- Quanto dual single digital on Equity and FX:
$$V_0^d = 10,000 \cdot E^{Q_f}_T[1_{X(T)>L_X} \cdot 1_{S(T)>L_S}]$$
and should increase from 0 to under 5k and then decrease back to 0, being always below the 2 other digitals prices.

![Figure 10: Stability - Digits Price - FX ATM Vol absolute shift](./Fig/10.png)

Figure 10 shows the prices of all digitals behaving as expected.
Then we consider the expected behaviour of the FX Vega when shifting the FX ATM Vol:
- Quanto single digital on Equity: The FX Vega should be positive.
- Single digital on FX and Quanto dual single digital on Equity and FX: The FX Vega should be positive when the price is increasing and negative when the price is decreasing. It should be higher for lower volatilities because in that region, the initially OTM trade gets more chances to be ITM.

![Figure 11: Stability - Digits Price - FX ATM Vol absolute shift](./Fig/11.png)

Figure 11 shows the FX Vegas of all digitals behaving as expected.

### 2.5.1.6.2 Price Stability

As explained above, the price should increase from 0 to under 5k and then decrease back to 0, when increasing the FX ATM Vol.

![Figure 12: Stability - Price - FX ATM Vol absolute shift](./Fig/12.png)

Test passes as the price behaves as expected when increasing the FX ATM Vol.

### 2.5.1.6.3 FX Vega Stability

The FX Vega should change smoothly when shifting the FX ATM Vol and its behaviour should be in line with the price behaviour when shifting the FX ATM Vol. As explained above, the FX Vega should be positive when the price is increasing and negative when the price is decreasing. It should be higher for lower volatilities because in that region, the initially OTM trade gets more chances to be ITM.

![Figure 13: Stability - FX Vega - FX ATM Vol absolute shift](./Fig/13.png)

Test passes as the FX Vega behaves as expected when increasing the FX ATM Vol.

## 2.5.1.7 Equity PIV - ATM Vol Stress Test

### 2.5.1.7.1 Expected Price Behaviour when shifting Equity ATM Vol

Any change in the Equity ATM Vol should only be explained by the Equity digital within the dual digital.
Back to the Equity digital's price, in the zero rates and $X_0$ Notional, it writes

$$V_0^{d,EQ} = N(f(\sigma))$$

with 
$$f(\sigma) = ln(\frac{S_0}{L_S}) \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma\sqrt{T} - \rho\sigma_X \sqrt{T}$$

with the derivative w.r.t $\sigma$
$$f'(\sigma) = -ln(\frac{S_0}{L_S}) \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma^2\sqrt{T}} - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{T}$$

and the limits w.r.t $\sigma$
$$lim_{\sigma \rightarrow +\infty}f(\sigma) = -\infty$$
$$lim_{\sigma \rightarrow 0}f(\sigma) = -\infty$$

because the trade is initially OTM: $ln(\frac{S_0}{L_S}) < 0$.
Thus the Equity Digital price should increase from 0 to a value under $\frac{1}{2}$ and then decrease back to 0, when increasing the Equity ATM Vol $\sigma$.
Similarly, the dual digital price should increase from 0 to a value under 5k and then decrease back to 0, when increasing the Equity ATM Vol.
According to the price behaviour the Equity Vega should be positive when the price is increasing and negative when the price is decreasing. It should be higher for lower volatilities, as in that region, the initially OTM trade gets more chances to be ITM.

### 2.5.1.7.2 Price Stability

As explained above, price should increase from 0 to a value under 5k and then decrease back to 0, when increasing the Equity ATM Vol.

![Figure 14: Stability - Price - Equity ATM Vol absolute shift](./Fig/14.png)

Test passes as the price behaves as expected when increasing the Equity Equity ATM Vol.

### 2.5.1.7.3 Equity Vega Stability

The Equity Vega should change smoothly when shifting the Equity Equity ATM Vol and its behaviour should be in line with the price behaviour when shifting the Equity Equity ATM Vol. As explained above, the Equity Vega should be positive when the price is increasing and negative when the price is decreasing. It should be higher for lower volatilities, as in that region, the initially OTM trade gets more chances to be ITM.

![Figure 15: Stability - Equity Vega - EQ ATM Vol absolute shift](./Fig/15.png)

Test passes as the Equity Vega behaves as expected when shifting the Equity Equity ATM Vol.

## 2.5.1.8 EUR Curve Stress Test

![Figure 17: Stability - Price - USD yield Bump](./Fig/17.png)

Test passes as the price changes smoothly when shifting the USD curve.

## 2.5.1.10 Correlations Stress Test

### 2.5.1.10.1 Price Stability

The correlation here is between the Equity and the FX. We use the same values for correlations both in the flat correlations input and the correlation skew inputs.
The price should increase when increasing the correlations.

![Figure 18: Stability - Price - EQ-FX Correlation](./Fig/18.png)

Test passes as the price increases when increasing the correlations.

## 2.5.1.11 Shifting Product Parameters

### 2.5.1.11.1 Equity Barrier Stress Test

As the Equity Barrier increases, the KO probability increases, and the price should decrease.

![Figure 19: Stability - Price - EQ Barrier relative shift](./Fig/19.png)

Test passes as the price decreases when increasing the Equity Barrier.

### 2.5.1.11.2 FX Barrier Stress Test 

As the FX Barrier increases, the KO probability increases, and the price should decrease.

![Figure 20: Stability - Price - FX Barrier relative shift](./Fig/20.png)

Test passes as the price decreases when increasing the FX Barrier.

## 2.5.2 Adding InverseCDFInterpolationType = Linear: SIMCOPULA when interpolating the inverse of DBOPTVOL_AFSABR_InverseCDF with SIMCOPULA: R_500_121

### 2.5.2.1 Model Change Description

An issue is interpolated when the CDF comes from an AFSABR model. The default interpolation of the inverse CDF in almost all cases of AFSABR interpolation is very unstable in case of AFSABR where the pdf is not continuous. To fix, a new field in DBOPTVOL objects called inverseCDFInterpolationType has been added that could be set to LINEAR (i.e., linear interpolation that was done before). The only other interpolation method allowed is NATURALCUBIC (i.e., corresponds to the unstable interpolation that was done before). The default value of the interpolation is LINEAR, which is believed to be much better than the natural cubic spline because:

- it is stable
- it is consistent with the AFSABR pricing. When pricing using AFSABR models, the pdf is assumed to be piecewise constant on the AFSABR grid, i.e., the AFSABR CDF is assumed to be piecewise linear. So even if the natural cubic spline interpolation was stable, linear interpolation would be a better choice because it would correspond to the exact CDF used for analytical pricing with AFSABR.

## 2.5.2.2 InverseCDFInterpolationType: Flag description

The new flag InverseCDFInterpolationType is for a DBOPTVOL object and is relevant when CoputaMethod = SIMCOPULA. The default is NATURALCUBIC.

This flag defines the method used to interpolate the inverse CDF of a DBOPTVOL rate when pricing with SIMCOPULA. The only two supported values for now are: NATURALCUBIC and LINEAR. NATURALCUBIC is natural cubic splines and corresponds to the interpolation method that was used before. LINEAR is linear interpolation and should solve stability issues.

This field only impacts the interpolation of AFSABR CDF in SIMCOPULA.

## 2.5.2.3 Trade used for Testing

We consider the following quanto single digital paying at time T:

$$1_{CMS(T) > H}$$

This amount in paid in the domestic currency d.

- domestic currency d is EUR, CMS currency f is GBP
- Maturity is 11Y, Notional = 1, H = 0.02

The Stability tests below are run once with InverseCDFInterpolationType = NATURALCUBIC and once with InverseCDFInterpolationType = LINEAR to show that setting InverseCDFInterpolationType to LINEAR does indeed fix stability issues.

## 2.5.2.4 Convergence Test

In this section we test the convergence of the Monte Carlo SIMCOPULA. The convergence is tested increasing the number of SIMCOPULA simulation paths.
Model configuration for CorrelationSkew is TermSkew.
The trade is the quanto digital trade described in section 2.5.2.3.
We price it with an increasing number of SIMCOPULA simulations NumberSims from 10k to 190k.

### 2.5.2.4.1 Convergence: Price

We check the convergence of the quanto digital price. We compute the error caused by seed variance (Error = StdDev(Replications)/MeanPrice).
Test passes if ratio declines rapidly when NumberSims increases.

![Figure 21: Price Convergence - Quanto Digital - 11Y](./Fig/21.png)

Test passes, as the Error decreases when NumberSims increases. Price shows good stability from 20K sims.

- parallel shifts of the IR curves and relative shifts of FX spot
- absolute shifts of volatilities
- relative shifts of the correlation parameters

The trade is the Quanto Digital trades described in section 2.5.2.3.
Model configuration for CorrelationSkew is TermSkew.
Tests pass if the prices and risks vary smoothly when shifting the market parameters.

### 2.5.2.5.1 Stability: Price - EUR IR Curve parallel shift

The price should vary smoothly when bumping the EUR IR Curve.

![Figure 24: Stability - Price varies smoothly with EUR IR Curve parallel shift - Quanto Digital - 11Y](./Fig/24.png)

Test passes as the price varies smoothly when bumping the EUR IR Curve.

### 2.5.2.5.2 Stability: Price - GBP IR Curve parallel shift

Given the upper barrier on the GBP cms rate, the price should decrease when bumping up the GBP IR Curve.

![Figure 25: Stability - Price decreases when bumping up GBP IR Curve with parallel shift and using InverseCDFInterpolationType = LINEAR fixes issues - Quanto Digital - 11Y](./Fig/25.png)

Test passes as the price behaviour w.r.t GBP curve is as expected.
Figure 25 also shows that using InverseCDFInterpolationType = LINEAR fixes the stability issue noticed with InverseCDFInterpolationType = NATURALCUBIC.

### 2.5.2.5.3 Stability: Price - FX Spot relative shift

The price should vary smoothly when bumping the FX Spot.

![Figure 26: Stability - Price varies smoothly with FX Spot relative shift - Quanto Digital - 11Y Starting DBA version 830, the property field InverseCDFInterpolationType has been removed as only LINEAR gives stable results.](./Fig/26.png)

Test passes as the price varies smoothly when shifting the GBP IR ATM Vol.

### 2.5.2.5.6 Stability: Price - Correlation relative shift

We shift correlation skew by relative shifts between -100% and +100%. For positive shifts, we apply modelCorr' = oldCorr + (1 - oldCorr) * bump not to breach the correlation upper bound of +1. We bump directly model parameters without any recalibration to test model smoothness. There's no guarantee that the PV should be flat.
Model configuration for CorrelationSkew is TermSkew.
The price should vary smoothly when shifting the FX-GBP Correlation.

![Figure 29: Stability - Price varies smoothly with Corr relative shift - Quanto Digital - 11Y](./Fig/29.png)

Test passes as the price varies smoothly when shifting the FX-GBP Correlation.

In this section we test the stability of the GBP IR Delta (MODE=FLATDELTAAVE). Model configuration is TermSkew.
Tests pass if the GBP IR Delta varies smoothly under parallel shifts of the GBP IR curve.

![Figure 30: Stability - GBP IR Delta varies smoothly with GBP IR Curve bump and using InverseCDFInterpolationType = LINEAR fixes issues - Quanto Digital - 11Y. Starting DBA version 830, the property field InverseCDFInterpolationType has been removed as only LINEAR gives stable results.](./Fig/30.png)

![Figure 31: Stability - EUR IR Delta varies smoothly with GBP IR Curve bump - Quanto Digital - 11Y](./Fig/31.png)

Test passes as the EUR IR Delta shows good stability.

### 2.5.2.5.9 Stability: Risks - GBP IR Vega

In this section we test the stability of the IR Vega (MODE=VEGA) to get the GBP IR Vega w.r.t the GBP IR 10Y2Y and 15Y2Y ATM Vols.
For each bucket where the Vega is not equal to zero we look at both the price behaviour and the Vega behaviour when shifting the ATM Vol for that maturity and we check that the Vega behaviour is smooth and in line with the price behaviour.
This mode returns the following Vega:

$$VEGA_{VOL} = PV(VOL + 1bps) - PV(VOL)$$

![Figure 32: Stability - Equity Vega varies in line with the price when shifting 10Y2Y Vol and using InverseCDFInterpolationType = LINEAR fixes issues - Quanto Digital - VOL. Starting DBA version 830, the property field InverseCDFInterpolationType has been removed as only LINEAR gives stable results.](./Fig/32.png)

Figure 32 shows that the GBP IR Vega w.r.t the 10Y2Y ATM Vol is smooth and in line with the price behaviour when shifting 10Y2Y ATM Vol. Test passes.
Figure 32 also shows that using InverseCDFInterpolationType = LINEAR fixes the stability issue noticed with InverseCDFInterpolationType = NATURALCUBIC.

![Figure 33: Stability - Equity Vega varies in line with the price when shifting 15Y2Y Vol and using InverseCDFInterpolationType = LINEAR fixes issues - Quanto Digital - VOL. Starting DBA version 830, the property field InverseCDFInterpolationType has been removed as only LINEAR gives stable results.](./Fig/33.png)

Figure 33 shows that the GBP IR Vega w.r.t the 15Y2Y ATM Vol is smooth and in line with the price behaviour when shifting 15Y2Y ATM Vol. Test passes.
Figure 33 also shows that using InverseCDFInterpolationType = LINEAR fixes the stability issue noticed with InverseCDFInterpolationType = NATURALCUBIC.

### 2.5.2.5.10 Stability: Risks - FX Vega

The FX VOL object in this trade is a DELTAVOL object with 5 volatility values per maturity corresponding to the volatilities of a 10 delta Put, a 25 delta Put, a Delta neutral, a 25 delta Call and a 10 delta Call.
We are interested in the stability of the Vega (MODE=VEGA) for each maturity. The Vega is non-zero for the 10Y and 15Y volatilities, so we only consider the 10Y and 15Y volatilities. As the input for maturity is 5 volatility values, we consider shifting all 5 values and looking at the Vega. The Vega we consider is the sum of the 5 bucketed VEGA values w.r.t each volatility. We use MODE=VEGA that gives 5 bucketed VEGA values for each of the 10 delta Put, 25 delta Put, Delta neutral, 25 delta Call and 10 delta Call and we get the sum of the 5 values. So that the displayed Vega for a given maturity is given as follows:

$$Vega = \sum VEGA_i$$

where $VEGA_i = PV(VOL_i + 1bps) - PV(VOL_i)$, i corresponds to each of the 5 volatilities: 10 delta Put, 25 delta Put, Delta neutral, 25 delta Call and 10 delta Call.

We look at both the price behaviour and the Vega behaviour when shifting all 5 10Y and 15Y volatilities and we check that the Vega behaviour is smooth and in line with the price behaviour. The volatilities initially range between 9% and 16%. We consider absolute shifts ranging from -7.5% to 15%.

![Figure 34: Stability - FX Vega in line with the price when shifting 10Y vols - Quanto Digital](./Fig/34.png)

Test passes as the FX Vega is smooth and is in line with the Price behaviour when shifting the FX 10Y Volatilities.

![Figure 35: Stability - FX Vega in line with the price when shifting 15Y vols - Quanto Digital](./Fig/35.png)

Test passes as the FX Vega is smooth and is in line with the Price behaviour when shifting the FX 15Y Volatilities.

## 2.5.2.6 Product Testing

In this section we consider the Price behaviour w.r.t the product features. Tests pass if the price behaves as expected when shifting the product features.

### 2.5.2.6.1 Product Testing: Price - EQ Barrier relative shift

As the payoff is contingent on an Equity upper barrier, the price should increase from zero to a constant value when increasing the Equity barrier.

![Figure 36: Product Testing - EQ Barrier relative shift - Quanto Digital - 11Y](./Fig/36.png)

Test passes as the price behaves as expected when shifting the EQ Barrier.

### 2.5.2.6.2 Product Testing: Price - CMS Barrier relative shift

Given the cms upper barrier, the price should increase when increasing the cms barrier.

![Figure 37: Product Testing - price increases when increasing cms barrier with relative shift - Quanto Digital - 11Y](./Fig/37.png)

Test passes as the price behaves as expected when shifting the cms Barrier.

### 2.6.3 MultiVar

In the MultiVar test we check the trade PV dependence under simultaneous stress of all risk factors of the trade. The PV change from different risk factors may have positive/negative impact on the PV. To avoid a possible cancellation, we take into account the sign of the partial derivatives of the PV for the risk factors under study. Thus, we will be able to see what are the maximal/minimal values PV have in the risk factors defined region.
The PV of the trade can be written as follows

$$PV(x_1, \ldots, x_n),$$

where the arguments $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ represent the various risk factors. We denote by $x_i^{EOD}$ the actual (End-of-Day) values and with $x_i^{LOW} \leq x_i^{EOD} \leq x_i^{HIGH}$ the local lower and upper bounds of the risk factors.
We define two functions of a single variable $\lambda$, defined in the interval [0, 1]:

$$f_{UP}(\lambda) = PV(x_1^{EOD} + \lambda \cdot (x_1^{EDGE UP} - x_1^{EOD}), \ldots, x_n^{EOD} + \lambda \cdot (x_n^{EDGE UP} - x_n^{EOD}))$$

$$f_{DOWN}(\lambda) = PV(x_1^{EOD} + \lambda \cdot (x_1^{EDGE DOWN} - x_1^{EOD}), \ldots, x_n^{EOD} + \lambda \cdot (x_n^{EDGE DOWN} - x_n^{EOD}))$$

where

$$x_i^{EDGE UP} = \begin{cases}
x_i^{LOW}, & \frac{\partial PV(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}{\partial x_i} < 0 \\
x_i^{UP}, & \frac{\partial PV(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}{\partial x_i} \geq 0
\end{cases}$$

$$x_i^{EDGE DOWN} = \begin{cases}
x_i^{LOW}, & \frac{\partial PV(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}{\partial x_i} > 0 \\
x_i^{UP}, & \frac{\partial PV(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}{\partial x_i} \leq 0
\end{cases}$$

Note that for $\lambda = 0$ the two functions match the EOD price, that is: $f_{UP}(0) = PV(x_1^{EOD}, \ldots, x_n^{EOD}) = f_{DOWN}(0)$, and for $\lambda = 1$ we have:

$$f_{UP}(1) = \max(PV(x)),$$

and

$$f_{DOWN}(1) = \min(PV(x)),$$

where $\max$ and $\min$ for the function $PV(x)$ are taken over the hypercube $x_i^{LOW} \leq x_i^{EOD} \leq x_i^{HIGH}$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$. Indeed, observe that for a convenient choice of the intervals $x_i^{LOW} \leq x_i^{EOD} \leq x_i^{HIGH}$ (i.e. locally), the function $f_{UP}(\lambda)$ is increasing and the function $f_{DOWN}(\lambda)$ is decreasing for $\lambda \in [0, 1]$.

### 2.6.4 Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) Testing

We perform the Interest Rate Stress Tests on the:

- DBOPT-RateDeterministic_FXMarket_AssetMarket_CorrelationSkew,
- DBOPT-RateDeterministic_EquityBlackScholes_AssetMarket_CorrelationSkew,
- DBOPT-RatesMarketAFSABR_FXMarket_EquityBlackScholes_CorrelationSkew,

models according to a range of ten different scenarios defined under the IRRBB framework. This framework is part of the Basel capital framework Pillar 2 (Supervisory Review Process). The goal is to observe the behaviour and accuracy of the DBAnalytics implementation for all the components of the model under those scenarios. Version 030 of the DBAnalytics is used for all the functions of the components listed above and are not directly impacted by the IRRBB scenarios. The BCBS document [11] describes eight Interest Rate shock scenarios that are required to be applied to IRRBB exposures in each currency for which a bank has material positions in the Banking Book. Eight Interest Rate currency dependent shock scenarios are prescribed that reflect currency-specific absolute interest rate shocks. Two of them (Steepener and Flattener) have been extended to take their opposite shift in order to define two additional scenarios: Steepener Negative and Flattener Negative. The IRRBB Interest Rate scenarios are summarized as follows:

- Parallel shock up,
- Parallel shock down,
- Steepener shock (short rates down and long rates up),
- Steepener Negative shock (opposite Steepener shift),
- Flattener shock (short rates up and long rates down),
- Flattener Negative shock (opposite Flattener shift),
- Short rates shock up,
- Short rates shock down,
- Long rates shock up,
- Long rates shock down.

Given a time bucket $k$, the Interest Rate shock for the time bucket midpoint $t_k$ for each of the ten scenarios $s$ are parameterized by elementary shocks $R_{s,c}$ for each shock type $s$ in parallel, short, long per currency $c$. For the purposes of our tests the following most extreme elementary shocks (in bps) were chosen:

$$R_{s,c} = \begin{cases}
200 & \text{if } s = \text{parallel }, \forall c, \\
250 & \text{if } s = \text{short }, \forall c, \\
150 & \text{if } s = \text{long }, \forall c,
\end{cases}$$

These shocks correspond to the elementary shocks for Euro currency. The interest rate shocks $\Delta R_{s,c}(t_k)$ for each scenario are as follows:

Parallel shock for currency $c$: a constant parallel shock up or down across all time buckets:

$$\Delta R_{parallel,c}(t_k) = \pm R_{parallel,c}$$

Short rate shock for currency $c$: shock up or down that is greatest at the shortest tenor midpoint. Long rate shock for currency $c$: shock up or down that is greatest at the longest tenor midpoint. Rotation shocks involve rotations to the term structure of the interest rate whereby both the long and short rates are shocked and the shift in the interest rates at each tenor midpoint is obtained by applying the following formulae to the shocks:

$$\Delta R_{flat,c}(t_k) = -0.65 \cdot \Delta R_{short,c}(t_k) + 0.9 \cdot \Delta R_{long,c}(t_k),$$
$$\Delta R_{steept,c}(t_k) = 0.8 \cdot \Delta R_{short,c}(t_k) - 0.6 \cdot \Delta R_{long,c}(t_k),$$
$$\Delta R_{steepn,c}(t_k) = -\Delta R_{steept,c}(t_k),$$
$$\Delta R_{flatn,c}(t_k) = -\Delta R_{flat,c}(t_k),$$

For each component, these ten scenarios and the base case scenario are tested. For each of those eleven scenarios, we perform a parallel shift of the rate curve on the zero rates, from $-15\%$ to $+14\%$ with a $1\%$ step. Results are plotted in the next section.

## 2.7 Engagement Process

The model developer documentation submitted to request ID 1. 16532, 2. 16739, 3. 16740, 4. 16532, 5. 16741 has been reviewed for sufficiency and completeness against the model approval request submission standards detailed in the Pricing Model Validation Key Operating Document [17]. The results of the initial review are detailed in Tables 38 and 39.


## 2.9 List of Validation Observation

As part of the validation of pricing models, MoRM may identify problems with the model that require an immediate implementation fix and cause further validation activities to be put on hold. Generally, remediation actions and timelines will be discussed and monitored as part of the MCWGs. To raise a validation finding MoRM would create a validation finding request in MARS, where the finding is described, a responsible action owner is assigned and a deadline for remediation of the finding is specified. MoRM can revoke the model approval if validation findings are not closed within agreed timelines. MoRM will only raise matters it identified through concrete remediation.

The model was reviewed for DBA version 630. Subsequent changes require further validation.
The Condition for Use ID 122722 is linked to the CorrelationSkew models:

- When interpolating the inverse of DBOPTVOL AFSABR CDF with SIMCOPULA, InverseCDFInterpolationType should be set to LINEAR as it is more stable than NATURALCUBIC.

Starting DBA version 630, the property field InverseCDFInterpolationType has been removed as only LINEAR gives stable results. As a result, the Condition for Use has been deactivated.

## 3 Assessment of Approach, Conceptual Soundness and Implementation

In this section, we review the methodology, conceptual soundness, and implementation of the DBOPT-CorrelationSkew model.

### 3.1 Assessment of Development and Modelling Data

The DBOPT model is an analytic and single horizon Monte Carlo model implementation that can be used for pricing derivatives on one or two underlyings that set at the same date. The purpose of the CorrelationSkew model is to properly price equity or FX path-dependent digitals at different strikes. Simple copula models such as Gaussian or Gumbel and capture the correlation of dual digitals, but they cannot capture the market of dual digitals at different strikes. The correlation skew model in this document gives more flexibility for a rich correlation skew surface.

### 3.2 Assessment of Methodology and Calibration

#### 3.2.1 Assessment of Methodology

After these consideration, the DBOPT model with the given configuration is the natural one for pricing under consideration. The aim of this CorrelationSkew methodology is to produce a correlation skew that is intuitive and can easily be calibrated to dual calls/puts or dual digitals. A requirement from the business is to have a sticky strike correlation skew. This correlation skew copula is constructed using a Monte Carlo numerical technique.

As the modelling only allows for payoffs with 2 underlyings where one of the underlyings is interest rate related, we use RatesMarketAFSABR. When the 2 underlyings are not interest rate related, interest rates are modelled using RateDeterministic model. When there is a quanto payoff with an Equity underlying, we use RatesMarket+FX+EquityBlackScholes+CorrelationSkew.

RatesMarketAFSABR uses similar parameters as the SABR model that is arbitrage-free. It can capture the volatilities implied by caps and swaptions.

#### 3.2.2 Assessment of Alternative Approaches

Compared to similar models, the implementation under consideration has the following strengths:
- It allows to model a richer non-parametric correlation, needed in order to capture the correlation skew evidenced by dual digitals at various strikes, which may not be captured by parametric asymmetric copulas.
- It can handle the correlation skew structure, so that the correlation between the underlyings depends on the market conditions (i.e., the level of the underlyings).

#### 3.2.3 Assessment of Calibration

- RateDeterministic: only uses the interest rate curve.
- RatesMarketAFSABR: The marginal distributions are calibrated to European swaptions. This is the same as the calibration for single rate derivatives as priced in DBOPT-RatesMarketAFSABR.
- EquityBlackScholes, FXMarket and AssetMarket: EquityParametricVol uses vanilla option prices.
The PIVAUTOFIT function to calibrate the PIV parameters. The calibration engine uses a GDA implementation of Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) for calibrating PIV parameters. The LM method is an iterative method. It starts with an initial guess for the parameters and the parameters are then modified in subsequent iterations until a pre-defined convergence criteria is met (see, for example, Press et al [24] for additional details). The objective function is to minimize the sum of squared errors between the target implied volatilities obtained from the market and the implied volatilities obtained by the model. It is possible to set different weights to the calibration instruments as part of the calibration process. The error tolerance level and the maximum number of iterations are used by the model.
- CorrelationSkew: CorrelationSkew requires historical observation of the underlying rates in order to correctly estimate the correlation and its parameters. The CorrelationSkew component of this model can in theory be calibrated to market prices of dual digitals or contingent options. However, those products are not liquid enough to provide accurate estimation of the correlation skew so the correlation skew itself is not calibrated and a flat correlation is usually used.

### 3.3 Assessment of Model Assumptions and Limitations

The model assumptions and limitations are listed in Section 3.1.1 and Section 3.1.1 respectively. In particular, the list of model assumptions and limitations is deemed complete and there is no relevant missing item that requires to be added to the current version of the document.

#### 3.3.1 Assessment of Model Assumptions

Table below lists the model assumptions and gives a statement on their conceptual suitability.

| Assumption | Conceptual Suitability |
|------------|------------------------|
| Arbitrage free market. | This is a fundamental assumption for any pricing model |
| Liquid Market | This is a reasonable assumption as the vanilla and variance swap market is liquid enough to provide quotes for different strikes and tenors. |
| Deterministic Volatility | It reasonable to assume that equity volatility is a deterministic function of time as the model is used for products which do not have a dependence on equity volatility skew. |
| Deterministic Dividends | For the type of products considered in this model, it is reasonable to assume that dividends are deterministic and can be proportional to spot price or can be in cash. |
| Deterministic Interest Rates | This assumption is appropriate for the simple linear payoff products considered. |
| No Jumps | The dynamics of the underlying equity and of the asset process are governered by diffusion processes without jumps. |

Table 36: Model assumptions and their conceptual suitability.

#### 3.3.2 Assessment of Model Limitations

Table below lists the model limitations, their impact and the mitigating controls in place.

| Limitation | Mitigating Control | Impact |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| Numerical Approximation(Monte-Carlo Error): When DBOPT model performs Monte-Carlo simulations, CorrelationSkew - TERMSKEW, Monte-Carlo simulations have an error associated with them that is a function of the number of simulations used. | This is a generic limitation related to numerical approximation error. Convergence testing is carried out for each risk showing that the numerical error is immaterial when recommended parameter settings are used. | The problem associated to the convergence with respect to numerical simulations is merely a problem of the numerical technique rather than the model itself. |

Table 37: Model limitation, their impact and the mitigating control.

### 3.4 Expert Judgments in the Model

In addition to the model specification detailed in section 2.3, the market inputs specified in section 2.3 are subject to IPV process.

The CorrelationSkew requires historical observation of the underlying rates in order to correctly estimate the correlation and its parameters. The CorrelationSkew component of this model can in theory be calibrated to market prices of dual digitals or contingent options. However, those products are not liquid enough to provide accurate estimation of the correlation skew so the correlation skew itself is not calibrated and a flat correlation is usually used. Therefore, the model parameter CorrelationSkew is calculated using the expert judgment of the trading desk.

### 3.5 Assessment of Model Documentation

Model users are responsible for seeking model validation for all new model and version implementations prior to use, through the submission of Model Approval Requests in line with the documentation standards set out by MoRM. Documentation should be sufficient to permit independent review and to facilitate understanding of the model by others, independent from the original developer.

The following steps are carried out in evaluating the Model Approval Request submissions:
- Upon being assigned to the Model Approval Request, the Primary Approver must review the submission to confirm completeness and adequacy against the minimum standards.
- If the Model Approval Request does not comply with submission standards or if additional information is required, the Primary Approver will reject the request, providing reasons for this as well as follow up actions required by the model owner/developer submitting the request, prior to resubmission.

MoRM will not commence validation until the Model Approval Request is accepted.
At any time during the validation process, MoRM have the right to request additional information they deem necessary for effective validation, even if outside the submission requirements listed in this document. MoRM may also ask for the model also recorded in MARS to be updated during the course of the validation. Additional supporting information obtained during the validation is also recorded in MARS.

## 3.6 IT Implementation testing

For Pricing models, implementation refers to DBA release and deployment refers to integrating them into risk calculators. The deployed model library executable code must be held in a secure and controlled environment or embedded in a system which is held in a secure and controlled environment.

DBAnalytics production system reconciliation: Independent model validation testing is undertaken using the DBAnalytics libraries and no further external analytics are being run in strategic production systems. It can be assured that model output produced with a consistent version of DBAnalytics will yield equivalent results whether run locally by individual users or in official production systems.

The following implementation tests have been carried out by DBA:
- Price and Greek Convergence:
  Price, Delta, FXDelta, Vega, Gamma, Convergence to intrinsic value with change in NumberSims.
- Sensitivity Analysis(standard and Extreme Scenarios):
  PV, FLATDELTA and FLATVEGA as a function of parallel CURVE shifts and relative VOL shifts. PV as a function of all risk factor stress.
- Taylor approximation:
  Check the consistency of the Taylor approximation of the price using spot price, curve delta and gamma and vega of the product.
- Product Specific Testing:
  Various product specific tests.
- Risk Factor Tests: PV and risk ladders under applicable VAR scenarios, CCAR shocks and IRRBB scenarios.

## 4 Independent Validation Testing

### 4.1 DBOPT-RateDeterministic_FXMarket_AssetMarket_CorrelationSkew-HybMultiDigital product

This model will be referred to by M4 in this section.

#### 4.1.1 Trade used for Testing

We consider the following HybMultiDigital trade:
- Valuation date is 1/10/2017
- Model Configuration is DBOPT-RatesMarketDeterministic_FXMarket[AUTO]_AssetMarket_CorrelationSkew[TermSkew].
- domestic and payment currency is USD
- Maturity 1Y
- Notional is 100

Payoff is:
$1_{x_{Asset FX} \geq 0} \cdot 1_{x_{EUR/USD} < 1.3}$

#### 4.1.2 Convergence

In this section we test the convergence of the Monte Carlo SIMCOPULA. The convergence is tested increasing the number of SIMCOPULA simulation paths. The model configuration for CorrelationSkew is TermSkew.
The trade is the HybMultiDigital trade described in section 4.1.1. The HybMultiDigital trade has a 1Y expiry. We price it with an increasing number of SIMCOPULA simulations: NumberSims = 1k, 5k, 10k, 30k, 50k, 70k, 90k, 110k.

#### 4.1.2.1 Convergence: Price

We check the convergence of the HybMultiDigital price. We compute the error caused by seed variance (Error = $\frac{StandardDeviation}{\sqrt{NumberSims}}$).

### 4.1.10 Taylor Expansion

In this section we review the Taylor testing for the HybMultiDigital. The idea is to compare the Taylor series approximation to the DBAnalytics produced price, w.r.t the main underlyings of the product, i.e. the FXspot and FX DN Volatility. We produce:
- a 3D plot showing how the price of the product varies with curve/spot and volatility shifts.
- a contour plot showing how the approximation differs from the DBAnalytics produced price.

We consider the HybMultiDigital product. The trade is described in details in section 4.1.1.
The 3D plots show that the PV varies smoothly with FX spot and volatility bumps.
The behaviour is as expected, in line with Figures 50 and 51.
The contour plots show that the approximation is close around the initial point, but then it is less the case because the only terms taken into account are first and second order in spot and first oder in volatility.

![Figure 90: 3D plot showing price of HybMultiDigital as a function of FX spot and volatility shifts](./Fig/90.png)
