# Product and Portfolio

## Overview

Interest rate volatility models, such as the GSABR model, are explicitly used to price **interest rate swaptions** and **caplets** for any combination of expiry, tenor, and strike. These models enable the generation of a continuum of prices, which facilitates the use of numerical methods (e.g., replication, integration, Monte Carlo simulations) to price both single-index and multi-index payoffs. Below is a detailed breakdown of the products and portfolios supported by these models:

---

## **1. Single Index LIBOR/CMS Trades**

These include vanilla and structured trades based on a single underlying index, such as LIBOR or CMS rates. Examples include:

- **Caps/Floors and Swaps**: Vanilla interest rate caps, floors, and swaps.
- **Decompounding and Quarto Adjustments**: Adjustments for trades where the payment currency differs from the observable currency (quarto).
- **Swaptions**: Options to enter into a swap at a future date.

The ability to price these instruments accurately is crucial for risk management and hedging in portfolios involving single-index derivatives.

---

## **2. Simple LIBOR/CMS Spread Option Trades**

These involve options on the spread between two indices, such as two different LIBOR rates or a LIBOR rate and a CMS rate. Examples include:

- **Calls/Puts**: Vanilla options on the spread.
- **Digital Calls/Puts**: Binary options that pay a fixed amount if the spread exceeds or falls below a certain threshold.
- **Quarto Adjustments**: Incorporating adjustments for differences in payment and observable currencies.

These trades are commonly used in portfolio strategies to hedge against changes in the relative levels of interest rates.

---

## **3. Single and Multi-Index Structured LIBOR/CMS Trades**

These are more complex structured products that depend on one or more underlying indices. Examples include:

- **Fixed and Floating Range Accruals**: Products that accrue interest only when the underlying rate falls within a specified range.
- **Complete Spread Options**: Options on the spread between two indices, with additional features such as barriers or caps.
- **Complete Range Accruals**: Products that combine range accrual logic with other exotic features.
- **CMS Steepeners**: Products that benefit from an increase in the slope of the yield curve, often incorporating quarto adjustments.

These structured products are widely used in portfolio management to achieve specific risk-reward profiles.

## **Implied Distribution from Call Prices**

Having call prices, denoted as $ C $, for a continuous set of strikes allows us to derive the implied probability distribution of the underlying rate using the following relationships:

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):

$$
\text{cdf}(K) = 1 + \frac{\partial C}{\partial K}
$$
More precisely, the risk-neutral CDF is given by:

$$
\text{cdf}(K) = 1 + e^{rT} \frac{\partial C}{\partial K}
$$
where $r$ is the risk-free rate and $T$ is the time to maturity.

### Probability Density Function (PDF):

$$
\text{pdf}(K) = \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial K^2}
$$
With the complete risk-neutral formulation:

$$
\text{pdf}(K) = e^{rT} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial K^2}
$$
This computed distribution can then be used to price multi-index, non-callable payoffs by employing copulas. For example:

- **Midcurve Pricing**: Copulas can be used to model the joint behavior of multiple underlying rates, enabling accurate pricing of midcurve options and other multi-index products.

## **Conclusion**

The GSABR interest rate volatility model plays a pivotal role in pricing and risk management across a wide range of interest rate derivatives. Its ability to generate a continuum of prices for various strikes, expiries, and tenors makes it indispensable for:

1. Pricing vanilla and structured single-index products.
2. Pricing multi-index products using advanced techniques like copulas.
3. Deriving implied distributions for complex payoff structures.

By providing arbitrage-free prices and implied volatilities, the model ensures consistency and accuracy in the valuation of both simple and exotic derivatives.
