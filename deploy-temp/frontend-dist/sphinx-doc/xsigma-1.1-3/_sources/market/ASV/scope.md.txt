# Scope

## Model Purpose and Intended Usage

### Primary Objectives

The ASV volatility has been designed to be used globally for all equity underlyings as a volatility-strike parameterization. The model serves as a unified framework that addresses the fundamental challenges in equity volatility surface modeling across different asset classes and market conditions.

### Core Applications

**Volatility Surface Construction**:
- Primary parameterization for liquid maturity volatility surfaces
- Strike-dependent volatility modeling for equity options
- Unified approach for both single stocks and equity indices
- Real-time volatility surface updates for trading applications

**Risk Management**:
- Greeks calculation for portfolio risk assessment
- Scenario analysis and stress testing capabilities
- Hedge ratio determination for volatility-sensitive positions
- Model validation and performance monitoring

**Derivative Pricing**:
- Vanilla option pricing across all equity underlyings
- Exotic option valuation requiring volatility surface inputs
- Structured product pricing with complex volatility dependencies
- Monte Carlo simulation inputs for path-dependent derivatives

### Scope Boundaries

**Included in ASV Framework**:
- Volatility parameterization for liquid maturities
- Strike-dependent volatility modeling
- Parameter fitting and calibration procedures
- Local volatility surface generation
- Arbitrage-free validation support

**Excluded from ASV Framework**:
- **Time Interpolation**: Volatility computation for non-reference maturities is independent of ASV parameterization and is performed by the volatility surface class
- **CCAR Volatility Scenarios**: Stress testing scenarios are independent of the parameterization used for liquid maturities
- **Arbitrage Monitoring**: Calendar and butterfly arbitrages from negative forward volatility or negative probability density functions are handled by external frameworks

### Integration with External Systems

| Component | Responsibility | Integration Point |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Time Interpolation** | Volatility Surface Class | Non-reference maturity volatility calculation |
| **CCAR Scenarios** | Stress Testing Framework | Regulatory stress scenario application |
| **Arbitrage Monitoring** | Volatility Fitter Framework | Real-time arbitrage detection and prevention |
| **Forward Curves** | Market Data Systems | Reference forward and anchor strike determination |

## Conceptual Soundness

### Market Context

The implied volatility surface construction requires a discrete set of market data (implied volatilities or prices) for different strikes and maturities. Financial institutions typically employ two major approaches, each with distinct advantages and limitations.

### Alternative Approaches Analysis

#### 1. Stochastic Volatility Models

**Examples and Characteristics**:
- **Heston Model**: Provides theoretical foundation but limited practical flexibility
- **SABR Model**: Preferred for analytical approximations and theoretical rigor

**Limitations**:
- Struggle to fit liquid listed maturities accurately
- Computationally intensive, unsuitable for continuous automated fitting
- Non-intuitive parameters that lack direct market interpretation
- Time-consuming calibration processes incompatible with real-time requirements

**Assessment**: While theoretically sound, stochastic volatility models prove impractical for high-frequency, automated volatility surface construction required in modern trading environments.

#### 2. Parametric Representations

**Examples and Characteristics**:
- **Quadratic Functions**: Simple moneyness-based parameterizations
- **SVI (Stochastic Volatility Inspired)**: Popular industry standard with analytical tractability

**Limitations**:
- **SVI Challenges**: Non-intuitive parameters and non-orthogonal wing parameters
- **Arbitrage Issues**: SVI may not guarantee arbitrage-free surfaces in all market conditions
- **Limited Flexibility**: Simple parametric forms may not capture complex market dynamics
- **Calibration Instability**: Parameter correlation can lead to unstable fitting results

**Assessment**: Traditional parametric approaches provide computational efficiency but often sacrifice either interpretability or robustness.

### ASV Design Rationale

#### Historical Context in Our Project

The development of ASV was driven by specific institutional requirements:

**Business Requirements**:
- Fast calibration of volatility surfaces for all traded underlyings
- Intuitive parameterization with "strike-localized" parameter impacts
- Unified approach reducing operational complexity across asset classes
- Stable parameters suitable for automated trading systems

**Legacy System Limitations**:
Initial polynomial-based parameterizations included:

**Taylor Parameterization**:
- **Usage**: Primarily by index trading desks
- **Characteristics**: Highest parameter count enabling fits to highly liquid index maturities
- **Advantages**: Flexible fitting capability for complex volatility structures

**Critical Shortcomings of Taylor**:
- **Over-parameterization**: Led to overfitting and parameter instability
- **Structural Irregularities**: Reliance on strike-axis cutoffs created discontinuities
- **Poor Local Volatility**: Irregular functional forms degraded local volatility quality
- **Asset Class Limitations**: Inadequate for single stocks due to low liquidity requirements
- **Operational Complexity**: Different parameterizations sacrificed potential synergies

### ASV Advantages Over Legacy Models

#### Technical Improvements

| Aspect | Taylor Parameterization | ASV Parameterization |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Parameter Count** | High (overfitting risk) | Minimal (5 fitted + 3 non-fitted) |
| **Parameter Orthogonality** | Poor (correlated parameters) | Excellent (independent effects) |
| **Stability** | Poor (unstable under stress) | High (consistent across regimes) |
| **Interpretability** | Low (mathematical constructs) | High (market-intuitive parameters) |
| **Asset Class Coverage** | Index-focused | Universal (stocks and indices) |
| **Local Volatility Quality** | Poor (discontinuities) | Good (smooth analytical form) |

#### Conceptual Advantages

**Minimal Parameter Design**:
- Reduces overfitting risk inherent in high-dimensional parameter spaces
