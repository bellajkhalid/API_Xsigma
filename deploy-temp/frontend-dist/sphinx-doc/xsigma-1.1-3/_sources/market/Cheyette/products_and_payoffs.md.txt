# Products and Payoffs

## Description

The CLV model will be used to price Bermudan swaptions, callable inverse floaters (CIF) and callable capped floaters (CCF) and calculate GMS loss for these products. Currently under Xsigma, all Bermudan swaptions, CIFs and CCFs are single currency, namely the currency of all cash flows is the same, which is also the denomination currency of index.

## Bermudan Swaption

The Bermudan swaption consists of a funding leg, a structured leg and an option leg.

### Funding Leg

For the i-th flow of the funding leg, the primary factors are margin $m_0^i$ and rate index $I_0$, the payoff is as below:

$$Cpn = N \times DCF_0^i \times (I_0^i + m_0^i)$$

where $I_0^i$ is reset of $I_0$ at the i-th coupon flow from funding leg.

### Structured Leg

For the i-th flow of the structured leg, the primary factor is margin $m_1^i$, the payoff is as below:

$$Cpn = N \times DCF_1^i \times m_1^i$$

Here DCF (day count fraction) of each coupon flow of each leg is calculated from the corresponding accrual start and end dates of that particular flow, and N is trade notional; for a bullet swaption, N is constant for each flow; for an accreter, ${N_i}_{i=1,...,n}$ is an increasing sequence, while for an amortizer, ${N_i}_{i=1,...,n}$ is a decreasing sequence.

The value of $m_0^i$ and $m_1^i$ may vary by coupons, but the definition of the underlying index $I_0$ is a specific Libor index which will be the same for the entire trade.

### Option Leg

For the option leg, the payoff is as below:

If Long/Short = Long (Short) and Option Right = Cancel, at exercise we (counterparty) decide to cancel the swap and pay fee or keep the option until next exercise.

$$option = max(min)\{-remaining\ swap + F_0, remaining\ option\}$$

If Long/Short = Long (Short) and Option Right = Enter, at exercise we (counterparty) decide to enter into the remaining swap and receive fee or keep the option until next exercise.

$$option = max(min)\{entered\ swap + F_0, remaining\ option\}$$

This is a Bermudan style option giving the right to enter or cancel a swap on a set of exercise dates. The Long/Short and Option Right would be defined at leg level and cannot be changed per exercise. The swap is made of the structured and funding legs with a start date on or after the effective date of the exercise as described above. Upon exercise, a settlement fee $F_0$ can also be applied.

## CIF/CCF

The CIF/CCF consists of a funding leg, a structured leg and an option leg.

### Funding Leg

For the i-th flow of the funding leg, the primary factors are margin $m_0^i$ and rate index $I_0$, the payoff is as below:

$$Cpn = N \times DCF_0^i \times (I_0^i + m_0^i)$$

where $I_0^i$ is reset of $I_0$ at the i-th coupon flow from funding leg.

### Structured Leg

For the i-th flow of the structured leg, the primary factors are margin $m_1^i$, rate index $I_0$, gearing $G^i$ and floor/cap values $F^i/C^i$, the payoff is as below:

$Cpn = N \times DCF_1^i \times max(F^i, min(C^i,G^iI_0^i+m_1^i))$, for callable inverse floater

$Cpn = N \times DCF_1^i \times min(C^i,G^iI_0^i+m_1^i)$, for callable capped floater

where $I_0^i$ is reset of $I_0$ at the i-th coupon flow from structured leg.
Here N is trade notional, and DCF (day count fraction) of each coupon flow of each leg is calculated from the corresponding accrual start and end dates of that particular flow.

The value of $m_0^i$, $m_1^i$, $G^i$, $F^i$, $C^i$ may vary by coupons, but the definition of the underlying index $I_0$ is a specific Libor index which will be the same for the entire trade.

### Option Leg

For the option leg, the payoff is as below:

If Long/Short = Long (Short) and Option Right = Cancel, at exercise we (counterparty) decide to cancel the swap and pay fee or keep the option until next exercise.

$$option = max(min)\{-remaining\ swap + F_0, remaining\ option\}$$

If Long/Short = Long (Short) and Option Right = Enter, at exercise we (counterparty) decide to enter into the remaining swap and receive fee or keep the option until next exercise.

$$option = max(min)\{entered\ swap + F_0, remaining\ option\}$$

This is a Bermudan style option giving the right to enter or cancel a swap on a set of exercise dates. The Long/Short and Option Right would be defined at leg level and cannot be changed per exercise. The swap is made of the structured and funding legs with a start date on or after the effective date of the exercise as described above. Upon exercise, a settlement fee $F_0$ can also be applied.

## Relationship to Other Approved Models / Payoffs

European swaption is a degenerated case of Bermudan swaption with only 1 option exercise date.

With these inputs, swap cash flows and date schedule can be generated. More details about schedule generation process can be found in [14].

## Outputs

The output is the PV and risks of the corresponding payoff.

Risks are calculated internally and will be explained more in details in Section 7.

## Payoff Analysis

As most of simple exotic payoffs, Bermudan swaption/CIF/CCF are sensitive to both rate and volatility. Therefore it has all the standard risks such as Delta, Vega, SABR risks, etc.

Regarding the volatility part, most simple exotic payoffs have sensitivities not only to term volatilities and skew, but also to forward volatility and forward skew. This is one of the main advantages to use CLV as this model captures not only term skew but also forward volatility very well, which we will examine more in later sections.

It is also noticed that these payoffs have little sensitivities to correlation, rendering them suitable to be priced using CLV.
