# Assumptions and Limitations

## Model Assumptions

### Fundamental Assumptions

**Single Factor Model**:
The CLV model is fundamentally a one-factor short rate model. This assumption implies:
- All interest rates are perfectly correlated
- The entire yield curve is driven by a single stochastic factor
- Forward rate correlations are implicitly assumed to be 1.0
- Spread dynamics between different rate indices are deterministic

**Risk-Neutral Pricing**:
The model assumes:
- Existence of a risk-neutral probability measure
- No arbitrage opportunities in the market
- Perfect liquidity and continuous trading
- Zero transaction costs and bid-ask spreads

**Market Completeness**:
The model assumes:
- Sufficient market instruments for calibration
- Consistent and arbitrage-free market data
- Stable market conditions during calibration period
- Representative market prices for calibration instruments

### Mathematical Assumptions

**Short Rate Dynamics**:
- Short rate follows displaced lognormal dynamics
- Local volatility function is well-defined and bounded
- Mean reversion parameter is positive and time-dependent
- Volatility and skew parameters are piecewise constant

**Analytical Approximations**:
- First-order Taylor expansion accuracy for swap rate dynamics
- Frozen $\Phi(t)$ approximation at its expectation
- Time-averaging of volatility and skew parameters
- Numerical integration accuracy for parameter calculation

**PDE Solution**:
- Existence and uniqueness of PDE solution
- Boundary conditions are properly specified
- Numerical discretization convergence
- Stability of finite difference schemes

### Market Data Assumptions

**Yield Curve Construction**:
- Input yield curve is arbitrage-free
- Interpolation methods preserve smoothness
- Forward rates are well-defined
- Curve construction methodology is consistent

**Volatility Surface**:
- Swaption volatility surface is arbitrage-free
- Volatility quotes are representative of market conditions
- Skew parameters are stable and well-defined
- Calibration instruments are liquid and reliable

**Currency and Index Assumptions**:
- Single currency framework (no FX risk)
- Consistent index definitions across instruments
- Stable fixing methodologies
- No basis risk between different rate indices

## Model Limitations

### Structural Limitations

**Single Factor Constraint**:
The most significant limitation of the CLV model is its single-factor nature:

- **Cannot price correlation-dependent payoffs**: Spread options, basis swaps, and other instruments dependent on rate correlations cannot be accurately priced
- **Limited forward rate dynamics**: All forward rates move in perfect correlation, which may not reflect market reality
- **Simplified yield curve evolution**: Complex yield curve reshaping scenarios are not captured

**Local Volatility Framework**:
- **Path dependency**: Local volatility depends on the level of the short rate, which may not capture all market dynamics
- **Calibration constraints**: Limited flexibility in fitting complex volatility surfaces
- **Forward skew limitations**: May not perfectly capture forward-starting volatility skew

### Numerical Limitations

**PDE Solver Constraints**:
- **Grid limitations**: Finite grid size may introduce boundary effects
- **Discretization errors**: Finite difference approximations introduce numerical errors
- **Computational complexity**: Large grids required for high accuracy
- **Stability conditions**: Time step restrictions for numerical stability

**Calibration Limitations**:
- **Local minima**: Optimization may converge to local rather than global minima
- **Parameter instability**: Calibrated parameters may be sensitive to market data changes
- **Overfitting risk**: Model may overfit to calibration instruments
- **Convergence issues**: Calibration may fail under extreme market conditions

### Market Condition Limitations

**High Volatility Environments**:
The model is not recommended for use under very high volatility conditions:
- High volatility makes the rate process very diffusive
- Affects numerical stability and accuracy of the PDE solver
- May lead to unrealistic rate projections
- Common limitation for HJM family of models

**Extreme Skew Conditions**:
The model is not recommended under very high skew conditions:
- Displaced lognormal framework may break down
- Analytical approximations may become inaccurate
- Calibration may become unstable
- Risk calculations may become unreliable

**Market Stress Scenarios**:
- **Liquidity crises**: Model assumes liquid markets for calibration
- **Regime changes**: Model parameters may not adapt quickly to structural changes
- **Extreme rate environments**: Very low or negative rates may challenge model assumptions
- **Volatility spikes**: Sudden volatility changes may affect model stability

### Product Limitations

**Unsuitable Products**:
The CLV model should not be used for:

- **Spread options**: Require multi-factor modeling for correlation effects
- **Cross-currency instruments**: Single currency framework limitation
- **Correlation-dependent payoffs**: Any payoff depending on rate correlations
- **Multi-curve products**: Products requiring explicit basis modeling

**Limited Product Features**:
- **Complex embedded options**: May require more sophisticated models
- **Path-dependent features**: Some path-dependent payoffs may not be accurately captured
- **Barrier options**: Barrier levels may not be properly monitored in single-factor framework
- **Quanto products**: Currency hedging effects not captured

### Operational Limitations

**Data Requirements**:
- **Market data quality**: Requires high-quality, consistent market data
- **Calibration frequency**: May require frequent recalibration in volatile markets
- **Computational resources**: PDE pricing requires significant computational power
- **Model maintenance**: Requires ongoing monitoring and validation

**Risk Management Limitations**:
- **Correlation risks**: Cannot capture risks related to rate correlations
- **Model risk**: Inherent model risk from single-factor assumption
- **Basis risk**: Cannot capture basis between different rate indices
- **Liquidity risk**: Does not account for liquidity effects on pricing

## Usage Guidelines
